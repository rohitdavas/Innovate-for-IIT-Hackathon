This company is amazing!!!!! As a full time working mom I can't tell you how hard it is to keep up with keeping the house clean. I am a neat freak and they came in and made my house so spotless. It is such a breath of fresh air coming home and knowing I don't have to worry about anything! My house is so shiny and it even smelled good! You guys did a fantastic job and we will definitely be contacting you again! This cleaning came at the perfect time and the cleaning ladies were so nice and friendly! Thank you so much! You have made a life long customer!","10001":"Review is purely on the food because this is just standard quick casino fare and the venue is hard to find on the Venetian casino floor.\n\nHad the beef noodle soup.  I'm not chinese so not an expert but the noodles were hand made and soup was delicious.  I would recommend you try this dish.  Also tried the seafood pan fried noodles which were excellent as well, some of the best I've had in awhile.  We also had the siu mai which were passable.  \n\nOverpriced for what it is but if you're gambling at the Venetian and you want some noodles, I would try this over the crap pizza and sandwiches they have at the other end of the casino.","10002":"First of all, the inside is super clean and organized. They have beautiful cakes on the walls where you can see their talent. The ladies working there were also very fun and bubbly and were a pleasure to talk to. I was just there to pick up my birthday cake and WOW was I impressed! It was absolutely gorgeous and EXACTLY what I wanted! I will definitely come back and order more goodies!","10003":"I had a meeting for an estimate on June 1. Chris came to give the estimate, and was very knowledgeable. He said that he was a little busy and would get back to us after the weekend with an estimate. It is now June 29 and I have not heard anything back.","10004":"A fantastic place to train, especially if you want serious results.\n\nI don't say that lightly.  I've worked out at many different places through the years, and I am pretty picky in that regard.  I would strongly recommend this place, though.","10005":"I come here frequently for an upper lip wax. They are always able to accommodate me even without an appointment. I am so grateful for their kind service! I look forward to getting my nails done here soon!","10006":"I have been going to this nail salon for years, as it is close to my home and I used to get great service.  I'm not sure when the current owner took over, but I just had the worst pedicure I've ever experienced.  I decided to get there ten minutes early (and I'm glad I did), because the seven minutes in the chair prior to my pedicure was the most relaxing part of it.  When the girl came over to start, I showed her that I had a cut that was healing on my big toe and to be careful, and within two minutes (while cutting my nails), she hit it and it broke open.  The entire pedicure was over within 15 minutes (and yes, that includes the nail polish drying), and the whole thing felt so rushed that I actually felt worse than when I came in.  I'll mention that the previous time I had gotten a pedicure (about 3 weeks prior), another girl had cut open my foot and it started bleeding.  I should not have gone back, but since I've been going here for years, I gave them the benefit of the doubt (maybe this was her first day) and went back.  I will not be going back again with these owners, and if they want to keep their business, they should take a long, hard look at who they are hiring, and how satisfied their customers are when they leave.","10007":"As a non hot dog person I was not super excited to see the menu. However I ordered the vodka slaw and three hot sauces and it was so flavorful I got over the fact that I was eating hazardous animals scraps in the shape of a tube. The tots at first struck me as meh, as in not Orida tots, however the sauces I ordered - again - brought them to a new level of yummy. I got the momocho, Piri Piri, Thai chili and housemate ketchup. Not sure what was what because none of the sauces looked like any of the restaurant or jar versions I've tried before so I just kind of mixed and went with the combined flavor which was spicy and garlicky and yummy. The only reason for the three rating is that I would have loved some wings or another food option and the ability to rate 3.5 vs 3 or 4. Forced choice is not the friend of business establishments. In a nutshell, a definite must try at least once when you decide to cast your health and wellbeing concerns to the winds and dive in.","10008":"A great choice if you want something warm, fast and relatively inexpensive for lunch or dinner! \n\nDeer Garden has a full menu and gives you a choose your own mix menu where you can select the soup base (they even have MSG free ones! I know, it's rare in Chinese restaurants), the noodle type, and extra ingredients from meat to tofu. In addition, it comes with a free hot beverage. And the almond milk is amazing (made from powder but still great!).\n\nthe 4 of us ordered 3 bowls of soup and shared among ourselves. And tell you what, it was very filling! The tomato soup base is a MUST TRY.\n\nOverall, great experience would definitely come back =)\n\nAnd while the service isn't top notch, (nothing new in Chinese places), they did serve in lighting fast speed.\n\nAnother note is the place can get quite busy around lunch\/dinner time. Word of advice is to go 20 min earlier to skip the rush!","10009":"First off, Bookmans is definitely better than Barnes And Noble, this much is for sure. But as a former Flagstaffian, the Bookmans in Phoenix is nowhere near as plentiful and varied in content matter as is the Flagstaff Location...nor does it have a cafe, which is a must for a bookstore I feel. Furthermore, the trade credit dollars given have shrunk in comparison to the rise in the price of books on the shelves anymore. I understand that this is a business needing to make money to sustain, but sometimes it feels like I am being ripped off on both ends of the spectrum. Furthermore, there are several items I have purchased and then been told, not even one month later (and upon losing the receipts so just trying to take the item back for a lesser amount in trade credit) that they are not interested in rebuying from me. I wish there was some way the Bookman stores would intertrade stock, so that the same books are not always on the shelves. I rarely find a science book that is unique to the stock on hand anymore, and only go in maybe once a month if that. I wish there were more used bookstores in the area of Bookmans, because if anything it would force them to stay more honest and competitive..versus the monopoly it holds on the surrounding area which results many times in a more lackluster brand of service and selection because it can.","10010":"Today was my first time eating at Served.   I had the pleasure to meet the Chef\/Owner.   Chef Matthew is doing some crazy good things with this inventive menu!   I had the Roasted Pork Belly Bahn Mi and it was one of the best I've had.  Besides the sandwiches you can find some really interesting and creative takes on familiar items such as Oaxacan Braised Short Rib.  This spot is worth your time!!!","10011":"I had seen this place featured on some Charlotte afternoon talk show along with a few other places and where the pizza looked good on TV, it was the online menu that sucked me in! Goat cheese, pork belly, pur\u00c3\u00a9ed garlic! Sign me up! We recently found ourselves on that side of town (directly across from the Knights baseball stadium) so we knew we had to go. This place is tucked into an alley so Street parking isn't all that easy; I recommend going ahead and parking in the parking deck. The restaurant is very small and you order your pizza pretty much the same way you order from Subway or Moe's. Everything is right in front of you and they just pile it on...my husband got the meat eater and it's pretty normal- nothing out of the ordinary there but why go to a place like this and get something you can get anywhere?! That's like going to Baskin Robbins and getting vanilla! I settled on the Southern Comfort...a sweeter Alfredo sauce, cheese, basil, pork belly and corn. Added caramelized  onions and the girl making the pizza suggested I put some Italian sausage on it - sure why not! She also said \"I know this is gonna sound strange but when it's done, let me drizzle some honey on two pieces and see if you like it\" Honey? On a Pizza? Ok, I'm game...what a game changer! Omg! Wow! I can't even tell you how good it is- I'm glad she suggested it because I would NEVER have done something like that! This place is worth the hint to find! I promise you won't be sorry!","10012":"I stopped because it was very early (before 8am) and I need to pickup three things, I only expected to be able to get two here, but figured I'd try anyway. It looks like the remodeling is nearing completion, still work to do but getting there. I asked a few people they did try to help but after 40 minutes found nothing i was looking for. So I did what I should have done, slept in and went to Target across the street. There I found 2 0f the three things I went out for. I had to stop at a craft store for the last item and pretty much expected to. Thank You Target for being there, I will just sleep in next time, Promise.","10013":"So nice to see the old (Tatum & Shea) Bombay spice concept back. Granted I did not give the Cactus Rd. buffet a shot thanks to Yelp Reviews, I did want to see what Marigold Maison was about. Great ambiance and open kitchen, Sunil the head chef is always welcoming. Andy was a great host that kept our kids thoroughly entertained the entire evening. My kids now say let's go eat at \"Andy's Place\", not a name change suggestion just pointing out the impression he made. And as parents know entertaining the kids while out to eat can be a challenge. Lentil cakes and my standard chicken tikka masala were our choice that evening and they were as good as ever. I would recommend trying it out and will go again to see if they can edge up to 5 stars like the Bombay Spice of yore...\n\nA side note, as I was leaving the restaurant, a couple mentioned to Andy how their \"dinner was good but they miss the buffet\". Andy pointed out that reviews for the buffet were not favorable on Yelp, at which point the couple proceeded to say Yelp reviews are a fraud, bla bla bla...I couldn't bare listening to it and felt like I needed to stand up for Yelp as someone that really finds value from it. It's no fraud! You can quickly figure out which reviews are \"fraudulent\" and which are not, so I'm glad to see Bombay\/Marigold Maison is in touch with reality and Yelp's value add to restaurant owners. Ok off my soapbox. Go to Marigold Maison and tell them a Yelper sent you!","10014":"I'm here to comment on the conduct of one of the tour leaders taking a group of what appeared to be mainly senior citizens on a tour through Red Rock Canyon Park today.  Their convoy pulled up into the farthest parking lot at the second parking area after you enter the park. The problem was they pulled up on to the side of the walkway right behind parked cars.  That is where my experience begins.  I was with my family and we were in the process of backing out with old people in scooters right behind our car.  It was not safe to do so but tour leader #1 encouraged me to do so.  After successfully backing out I proceeded up the narrow lane created by the convoy parked unsafely on the right of us and the series of parked cars on the left. The left hand turn I have to make is particularly narrow due to the tour leaders scooter parked in the front of the convoy.  Tour leader #2 is in front of my car and recognizes the situation he has created for me.  Rather than get in his scooter and move out of the way he proceeds to gesture his hands and arms wildly assuming the role of traffic cop.  I was distracted by what amounted to me to be an unrequested buffoon show.  As my first pass was unsuccessful rather than allowing me the opportunity to correct my angle myself this buffoon proceeds to come to my drivers side window AND PUT HIS HANDS ON MY STEERING WHEEL....again I did not request his help in any way shape or form.  Now he is asking me to move my vehicle as he commandeers the steering wheel to correct my angle.  My family is looking on with startled discomfort as though to think whats this buffoon going to do next?  He created a highly unsafe situation as a result of his buffoonery...\n\nAs I was leaving this buffoon decides to save his own face and announce to the convoy of disbelieving tourists that \"He Cant Drive\".... are you kidding me?  You come into my family and my life unwelcomed in the most buffoonish way, create a buffoonish situation and now try to launch a buffoonish insult to your paying customers?\n\nI have not taken this tour would not recommend it based on my peripheral experience and would certainly caution anyone to place there lives in the hands of a clear buffoon tourist leader.  Ruined what was otherwise a lovely family day out.","10015":"Regardless of the rental car company, you need to take a shuttle to and from the Rent-a-car Center. We waited about 30 minute in 105+ degree heat on a hot Vegas Day waiting for a shuttle in line to just get on the shuttle. The drive is only about 10 minutes and once you get to the center it is easy to find your rental car company and to get on and off the garage. Just account for extra wait times to get to and from the airport if you travel in the summer or peak season time.","10016":"We went for dinner.  There is something to suit every taste, from prime rib and crab legs to friend chicken and pizza.  The food is average, the desserts are below average.  That said, at $30 per person, it's less expensive than most Strip dinner buffets.  If you are seeing an early show in the MGM Grand, consider eating here beforehand.","10017":"Sunday 6\/24\/2018 Jose came out to assist us with our A\/C unit. It went down the morning before and AHS sent Doctor Cool out to do our repairs. After reading the mixed reviews here i was rather skeptical and was not sure what to expect..  we have had other repair folks out from the home warranty company.. the fridge went out and that company had to come 3x just to fix it.. our pool pump went out and that company also took multiple visits to fix the issue.. long story short... Jose was very professional.. He let us know what was going on through the entire process and when he left everything was running great.. Doctor Cool definitely has a great employee in Jose and he did an outstanding job.. He made sure we were informed and happy with what he had done before he left... hats off to Jose and Doctor Cool for taking care of our needs.","10018":"Waited 2 hours as expected since this is still a new restaurant in Toronto. Main issues:\n1) My mom's steak diane was too sweet and the salmon was bland and dry\n2) I ordered medium rare steak diane and instead I got medium well. \n3) I complained to the server and the serve informed me that I had to pay the regular price for a new side of steak! WTF?!\n4) Server understood I shouldn't have to pay and asked what else he can do. So I asked for 2 free cheesecakes. He said he'll talk to his manager.\n5) Server said they can make me a new side of steak to still try it out. I agreed\n6) Good steak diane. Not sweet like my mom's steak and cooked well\n7) On the bill I saw a charge of side steak $7.99, I complained. Why the hell would I pay for a side steak to fix this companies incompetence? \n8) They don't accept gift cards, even the Yorkdale gift card. \n\nNever going here again. Poor customer service.","10019":"This Blimpie location is the best I've experienced. For the past 17 years I have grown to love this place. The other locations I've checked out have been overshadowed by the service and quality of this one. I will continue to make quick lunch trips from time to time. The same lunch staff seems like they have been here forever. Truly a staple at Tatum and Shea!","10020":"They're located inside the Partell Pharmacy so it can be somewhat hard to find, but they do have a sign outside the door. They provide a variety of different shakes and some times will have samples on the counter for you to try. I'm a sucker for their Chocolate Thunder shake. I docked a star because the drinks are pricey. Their employees are friendly and the service is great. They provide interesting nutritional books to read while you wait for your drink.","10021":"I never realized this Khoury's was tucked behind Lowe's until I went here for the St. Baldrick's event on 3\/11\/17. We attended this event as it holds a place in our lives for my late nephew who died of cancer. As you can see, this was probably the best event I have ever attended...we were here for hours on end with good drinks and good times! I ran into a coworker here as well, which made everything more fun and interesting.\nI tried a white wine that I don't remember the name of, but I'll be coming back here to find it. It tasted so good!","10022":"I've been there about 15 times by now....they never disappoint....there's this one kid about 20 yrs old that's an absolute artist and actually pays attention to what I say unlike many others","10023":"This was our fave pizza place. The monster pizza had so many great toppings. But tonight.... nope nope nope. Called in an order and was told 20 min. Showed up and was told 20 more. Walked back in after that 20 and they hadn't even put it in the oven. Asked for a manager and they said he was putting on sauce on pizza and couldn't come out. Asked for a refund and left. Left a long line of other angry people too. \n\nThis was avoidable - \n\n1. Call people when their orders are running late\n2. Apologize. Just once. You know, like you care about this issue. Give an explanation if you really want my sympathy or my future business. \n3. STOP TAKING MORE PHONE ORDERS UNTIL YOU GET CAUGHT UP. Seriously. \n4. Offer a future coupon or discount on this 60 min (!?) Order. \n\nDisappointing. But hey, there's always the Gilert location to try!","10024":"Broke my power button while replacing my broken screen. Would not accept responsibility. 2 stars for the screen repair","10025":"I have nothing but good things to say about Adams.  They can always make it here within the hour and have always been honest and upfront about repairs and cost.  We have been using them for at least eight years now and I would highly recommend them.  They are very professional, arrive within the time they say they will and will stay until the job is completed.  Twice now I have had them have to come out within the last month, one occasion was just yesterday when it was 115 degrees out and my system was blowing hot air.  They were here in an hour, which I was very surprised about because I know everyone, including their techs, were VERY busy yesterday.  Everyone I called said it would a few hours or \"tomorrow.\"  Thank you Adams Refrigeration for your quick service.","10026":"Great atmosphere, there sampler plate is fried to perfection, it does taste like they use the same frier for everything but it adds a good flavor. And they have great customer service. The wings are delicious try them grilled. I actually want to compare them to valley luna's grilled wing. The bathrooms are a little geto there is writing on the stall walls but appears to be very clean but is on sever need of seat covers.","10027":"I move to Vegas 2 years ago from Los Angeles.  Every stylist I went to ruined my hair.  I was about to give up until I purchased a Groupon for the Boulevard Salon. I checked on yelp and saw the reviews for Jessica so I made my appt with her.  All I have to say is WOW!!!!!  Jessica nailed the haircut.  Best haircut I have ever had.  I get so many compliments.  I have been back twice with the same results and am so happy to find a stylist who knows what they are doing.","10028":"Fairly new establishment as I'm told. Plenty of seating all around for drinks or light dining. \n\nDimly lit, great surf rock tunes, and fruity drinks = a great time. \n\n5 stars and hats off to bartender Bosco! For his attention to detail and GREAT local recommendations. When sparking up a convo about the city since I was only in town for a short time he personally mapped out a handwritten must do list around town.\n\nCome get your grog, collector mugs and fun all in one spot. \n\n-Cheers! Shameful Tiki :D","10029":"When I go out to eat, I rarely consider a Thai restaurant, just because everything I have had in the past is just okay. This is my go to from now on.  It's clean, fresh, and flavorful.  Kudos to the chef and staff.  I ordered the Pud Se Ew with chicken.  The veggies were not overcooked, the spicy was perfect and I was surprised at the level of presentation.  I will definitely be back!","10030":"For someone who's NEVER been a fan of Indian food I've got to give kudos to this great spot! Food was absolutely fantastic and the service was excellent. My girlfriend and I sat at the bar and admittedly my expectations were low... To my surprise, the food was delicious [we ordered the garlic bread thing-a-mabobber, along with a lamb and a shrimp dish, which were both fantastic!]. Our bartender\/server, Abraham, was great and he suggested some excellent wines to pair with our meals. I'm now admittedly a fan of Indian food and will certainly be a repeat customer of this gem of a eatery!","10031":"This is by far the worst theater I have ever went to in my life. We went on a Thursday and there were a bunch of pimple faced teenagers hanging around cussing, riding bikes, talking loudly as they seem to always do...anyway, I didnt want to upset my husband because he really wanted to see this movie.....We paid for tickets, still at a ridiculous price...walked in to a dirty entry way with some gothic idiot slurring and pointing to where the theater was located....the popcorn looked liked it was about to roll out its sleeping bag for the third night in a row....the slurpee machine spat out all over the outside of the cup and they didnt even clean it up or put it in another cup....By the way what is up with employers letting these kids have this wacked out surfer hair while at work. I feel like I am talking to a pomeranian with cystic acne....there are no beaches in Arizona, so why do you look like you spent the day surfing and playing an acoustic guitar outside Taco Tuesday for change....\n\nThe theaters are small and crowded and everyone seems to save seats, they will sell the front two rows so be prepared.\n\nWe got our money back before it started...this place is not cool.\n\nLock it up.\nYou are still Harkins, which is a well-known name....","10032":"I had ordered flowers a day in advance to be delivered at a business as a birthday surprise. \n\nThe flowers were \"guaranteed delivery\" before 4:30. After the recipient didn't mention receiving them I had to ruin the surprise and ask them. \n\nI had received an email saying they were out for delivery at 11 am. \n\nAt 5 pm I emailed them and was told they had a new driver who screwed up the delivery ... I was offered a refund and next day delivery or a 50% refund and delivery that night to their residence. \n\nI took the 50% and the flowers were delivered to the residence around 7 pm - but not after totally ruining the surprise\/missing most of the day anyway. \n\nThey responded quickly with a solution and the customer service was solid, but I wouldn't use them again or recommend them. It's not about the refund - it's about someone's special day being ruined over incompetence. \n\nThe flowers were dull and nothing in comparison to what was pictured on their website. Even the vase was dull. For 100$ and guaranteed delivery I expect way more. I could have gotten the same quality flowers at a grocery store for $20.\n\nThis was just a regular old Wednesday. I can't imagine the amount of ppl who use this company on Mother's Day and Valentine's Day to never have their loved ones receive their flowers. \n\nThe one star given was for the solid customer service, which was nice - but the product itself wasn't the best quality and the delivery was unreliable. \n\n***in my photos I added the bouquet that was shown on their website vs. The one that was actually delivered ***","10033":"Visiting the Phoenix area my wife and I were thrilled to see tonight's production of \"Guys & Dolls\". The theater itself is a little treasure: intimate and comfortable. The musical was amazingly good with a strong cast both in its singing and acting abilities. Highly recommended.","10034":"Sophie the Pom needed a hair cut as she just moved to Arizona. She was nervous to find a new beautician but after reading the great reviews at Pet Spa we decided to try it out. They squeezed in an appointment immediately for the next day to do us a favor. Very impressive customer service. Connie reassured me on the phone about her experience with teaching and continuing ed for grooming and styling dogs. She takes her profession seriously, as I do as well. Dogs don't want bad hair days. We feel very lucky to have found our new Arizona groomer.","10035":"I've been going to this Snap Fitness location for a bit over a year now and in that time I've managed to drop about 35 lbs. It's a great basic gym with just about everything I need. I say 'just about' because it is on the small side. There's only one free weight squat rack which is kind of a bummer when it is busy (which it has been lately) and it can feel a little cramped. \n\nThere are also little things that detract for me, like the fact that there are no 35 lbs weight plates, and there are limited weight plates in general. There are a ton of 45's but sometimes I need to only add a little extra!\n\nOther than that, really no complaints. No one bothers you and you can get in and get out in a good amount of time. The staff are friendly, and always willing to chat or help if you need anything. Lyle is a good guy! I'd just like maybe a few more upgrades somewhere in the near future.","10036":"Why does all that crazy stuff happen in Vegas? Fat Tuesday.","10037":"I heard this place was pretty good so I decided to try it out, my experience was bad. I've been to similar pizza places with the same \"build-your-own\" concept. I began building my pizza and when I got to the \"proteins\" I told the guy (didn't have a name tag) that I wanted all the proteins then he quickly said \"You can't do that, the cheese won't cook all the way\". I've been to Pieology and Fired Pie and they both had no issue with allowing me to put all the proteins and the pizzas cooked to perfection. It didn't seem like this guy was too fond of my idea of putting every meat because maybe they lose money that way or something, regardless I was shocked that this was my custom pizza and I couldn't even customize it to my liking. I ordered a pizza anyway and it was sub-par. Not bad I guess but next time I'll make the drive to Fired Pie in Downtown Phoenix instead.","10038":"Everyone is so kind and accommodating! Super quick service no matter the issue!!Drs & nurses are very knowledgeable and front desk is so, so nice!!","10039":"Amazing! Jon is incredibly polite, professional, and does a SUPERB job. After driving around 3 kids and two dogs for years our Tahoe looks a million times better","10040":"Absolutely hate it here! Management sucks, a\/c sucks, loud renovation sucks. Everything sucks! Especially the infested ass facility as a whole. I'm over this place. Lease is up in 2 months.\n\nMy main concern is the water. The boiler never works! And since it is always malfunctioning we are either left to take ice cold showers or have no water at all. I work until 10 pm, so when i get home i expect to take a warm shower. Not here you won't! It seems as though the hot water goes off at a certain time. That certain time i always after i get home. Its ridiculous!\n\nAs others mentioned the a\/c and heater issue, I'll mention it as well. Because they turn the boiler off and on, you don't have the luxury of setting your desired temperature. For instance its been hot out lately so the heat has been y turned off until November, only cold air is available. Now that may not sound too bad, but it has been raining heavily the past couple of days. I would love to come in my apartment, turn on the heat and warm up after being drenched in rain water. Sadly that won't be happening. If I'm cold i just have to suck it up or wrap myself in blankets because i cannot turn the heat on. Its really unfortunate!","10041":"The 2 stars is for the service. We went to the breakfast\/brunch buffet on the weekend of the GGG vs Canelo fight. The hostess and server were very rude and unprofessional. We've never had issues at the mirage buffet. The food is also really good. That morning the service was unprofessional and unacceptable. They must of forgot about customer service.","10042":"Had no idea what this place was about. A friend of mine told me check it out, and I'm glad I did. Great dinning area, clean and has TV's too! Blue Berry Cole Slaw was tasty! But the Fresh Apple Slices with Toffee Dip was pretty impressive! Any place that has bags while you wait is definitely a place you want to consider! Thanks Hector!","10043":"It makes me feel like eating home!so delicious and spicy. Best Chinese food in Phoenix\u00ef\u00bc\ufffd","10044":"Incredible burger, good happy hour prices, and the NFL network? All within walking distance of my apartment? What did I do to get so lucky?!","10045":"My friend and I saw Monkey Lights during our first Critical Mass ride, and HAD to have them.  My friend Gail is pretty relentless when she has a goal, and she had phoned up all the local bike shops by the next week to search for said lights (Google them - they're AMAZING).  The guys at Trailhead ordered them and we paid the same we'd pay on Monkeylectric's web site, less the shipping.  The guys were friendly and helpful when we went to pick up our lights, which came in just a couple of days.  The cafe is awesome, too.","10046":"I have been a customer of Looking Glass Window Cleaning company for 10 years...and with good reason. The team headed by Abraham are thorough, courteous, professional, clean, timely and protect my things when they come to do a job. They are such a pleasure to work with I have used their services for our offices. It's amazing to me how they are able to get the windows completely clean even after the worst sand \/ pollen \/ rain storm. Thanks Looking Glass Window Cleaning and special thanks to Abraham!","10047":"I give you a 5 star just for at least attempting to honor my expired Groupon that said I could use it for the dollar amount I originally paid instead of doing nothing, like all but one of your other locations acted.\n\nNot sure about your cleaning services, but customer service is very good. Thank you.","10048":"Went on the website last week and filled out a form saying please contact me as I would like to set up appt to get a quote.  Email says allow 2 business days.  That has passed.  Called this morning at 830am 6\/5.  Person who answered phone said will give message to sales reps who come in at 900am.   I guess Puckett's has so much business they don't need new customers.  If you aren't going to respond to requests via your website - don't offer that option.  Not sure if the breakdown for today is due to person answering phone or sales reps.  Definitely an interesting business model. \n\nUpdate:  three strikes and you are out.  I decided to go by the store in person since I had no response to my yelp email request and no response to my call.   Got there approx 1030 am on a Wednesday (6\/6).  There was no one in the showroom.  I stood around for about five minutes then followed the voices to the \"office area\" toward the far side of the store.  A woman asked me \"have you been helped\"?  To which I responded \"no, not yet\".  She said she would be right with me.  Ten minutes later she still did not appear.   So I have decided that they really do not need my business - right.  How many chances can I give them!!\nSadly a friend referred them as she had such a good experience.   I could not refer this store based upon my personal experience.  My search is still on for my new flooring.  It is now 6\/8.","10049":"Definitely one of the busiest stalls in the food court of the Faubourg building. \n\nI come here once in a while in between classes. Their noodles are always freshly made, and cooked to order.\n\nThis is one of a few locations in Montreal where the noodles are hand made and freshly made every day. Protip: it's cash only, and ask for some of their home made chilies they keep behind the counter for regulars.","10050":"Place seems like it would be a hipster trap but the food is flawless. Wine list is amazing * if you can afford anything on it.  Seafood platter to start and an all natural grass-fed beef steak to finish, with organic spinach in the middle. Flatout awesome and not at all what I expected.","10051":"I went in to look at the Mazda CX-5 and was not impressed with the service. The sales guy was acting put out that I was even there, needless to say I took my business elsewhere.","10052":"This place is legit. Top notch Mexican fare. The restaurant has been around for ages, and it looks dated, but clean. I very much enjoyed my stop in this place for lunch. I'd go back when I get the hankering for Mexican while in Chandler\/Mesa.","10053":"My favorite pizza topping is none and my favorite pizza crust is thin. On both counts, Ripe Tomato delivers results with their 9in 4-cheese pizza. \n\nI love that their pizza is freshly made, non-greasy and thin crust. Bonus points for the nostalgia of coke in a glass bottle. I usually go out of my way to grab lunch at this place. Wait time at the peak of lunch hour could be up to 10 minutes.","10054":"My expectations were definitely lowered since its an AYCE, but it's a special surprise for sure.\n\nFirst off, no sashimi at lunch time but it seems there are no downtown buffets that do.\n\nMy first visit was during supper and the sushi was pretty solid but the kitchen beef dishes stood out the most.\n\nAt lunch this time, the sushi was good and varied. The nigiri was alright ( the rice was just a tad dry).\n\nThe beef dishes were really the standouts here and a non-sushi lover can definitely find his\/her fix here.\n\nThe service was very quick and the menu selection is gigantic.","10055":"This place has been here forever (perhaps I exaggerate), why have I never walked in?! Because the second you walk in, you will smell the greatness that is freshly baked bagels. And while I have a tendency to stick to those oh-so-delicious Montreal bagels, this place has to be an exception. You can literally SEE the bagels rolling out of the ovens and straight into the baskets you get them from. Although I was hoping for a BLT, this wasn't an option, so I got the tuna salad with cucumbers instead. I honestly don't think it would have mattered WHAT I got, because the bagel was the star of the show. I will definitely be returning again!","10056":"The best wings in town! Friendly staff. Highly recommend the only thing id change is i wish there was a place to eat inside","10057":"I went in to get an international driver's license yesterday morning. It took no more than 5 minutes and the customer service was excellent.","10058":"Solid place. Have been going there for a few years.\n\nPeople have complained about the food, but in the last year or so, I've noticed a marked improvement in everything coming out of the kitchen.\n\nThe place has a lovely unpretentious vibe and the music they play is usually top-notch. The only reason I can't give it four stars is because the service can often be indifferent.\n\nStill a good place to enjoy a few drinks with friends.","10059":"Just like the reviews here in Yelp, the Pickle Barrel at Yorkdale Mall has a lot of inconsistencies that really makes this restaurant disappointing.\n\nI've been here less than half a dozen times and it's gotten progressively worse. I had a bad experience with our server and our food during my last visit in April.\n\nOur server expressed her disinterest in serving us from start to finish. She didn't take down our orders, insisting that she knew them, despite there being some dietary restrictions. Lo and behold, those things ended up in our food.\n\nI got the PB House burger from there and there was a real lack in flavour. I only know that because I've had it on multiple occasions and I loooooved it.\n\nI find big restaurant chains lack the ability to change when staff don't seem to care about their customers. Not sure if this location will likely change, but because they're situated in one of the biggest malls in Ontario, they'll always have customers.","10060":"Not being the biggest fan of country I was very hesitant to walk into this place when I first moved to Old Town, but after checking it out with my friends a few weeks in, I always know I will eventually end up here every Friday or Saturday night. Remembering that I was there is probably another story. Great food, great atmosphere, the staff are all very friendly and attractive. Their bouncers are very laid back, but lay down the law when need be. Although I lose my dignity there with Taylor M. on more occasions then I am proud of, it is safe to say that this is definitely a spot to check out when you're out in Old Town.","10061":"I decided to give this place a second chance after my first visit ended in extremely slow service and nearly raw eggs that made me sick. \nWe expected slow service on this visit because it was a Holiday weekend.  After waiting over an hour for our food, we asked to speak to the manager who told us that this should be expected because of the Holiday and offered no apology.  He went back to the kitchen and advised us that our food would be out in five minutes. After waiting another 10 to 15 minutes, the food finally came out one meal short. We were offered no apology or discount for the forgotten meal and slow service. Nothing on our ticket was comped. I was super bummed and wanted to like this place, but for \"OK\" food and bad service, it is not worth it.","10062":"The service by store manager was very rude. I wanted to buy something from their store that was on display and wanted to know why we could not buy the item. She was extremely defensive and I wanted to give her feedback that it made no sense not to sell something that was on display. She was very un appreciative she even said that she has so much experience as a store manager that she knew better and client feedback was unimportant.For companies who do not learn and take feedback from clients is a company that will fail. I was very discouraged from the experience.Clients who care enough to tell you are trying to make you improve. There are many stores to shop at and Muji does not have an edge I'll rather spend my money elsewhere. The store manager should have better customer service and a simple \" let me take your number so we can call you when the product is in store\" is simple 101 customer service","10063":"We weren't what sure what to expect from a 1:00pm comedy\/show.  Maybe we weren't expecting a lot since the tickets were very reasonable (expecially through one of those half-price tix places) however we thought the show was great.  Glad we noticed the good reviews here on Yelp. Definitely a good choice to fill a couple of afternoon hours if you want to get off the casino floor.","10064":"Expensive, but on par with the prices. \n\nI've heard good things, but tonight was my first visit.\n\nThe Grilled Italian Spiced Bread Cheese appetizer was excellent, reminiscent of a tapenade\/bruschetta spread on a bed of caramelized cheese.\n\nI had the togarashi crusted ahi tuna special that was served with broccolini and farro (?) in a curry broth. The curry broth was rich, nutty, and had a little kick to it. The tuna itself was cooked perfectly. The broccolini was cooked enough to become tender but was still crisp - perfect. It was an amazing dish, and I'm pretty sure anything resting in that curry broth would be wonderful.\n\nI also had the dark chocolate mousse which was rich, creamy, and flavorful.\n\nOthers I was with ordered short rib and rainbow trout and enjoyed their meals.","10065":"Just ok. Not the best choice for breakfast. Very limited menu and the staff is slow. I'd suggest maybe eating lunch here or dinner.","10066":"Great food and service!  We stumbled upon it too due to coupon, and so glad we did! Need to get the word out about this place, it IS a best kept secret in the North End right now!","10067":"Yippee!  Alaska Airlines totally redeemed themselves for me.  I got great customer service - the gate agent in SEA found me an aisle seat instead of a crummy middle seat.  The flight attendants (actually they are more like flight safety attendants - just saying, so give them the respect they are due) back to PHX seemed very conscientious about getting passengers to keep their stowed luggage in the overhead bins nearest their seats.  The inflight service was friendly and efficient, soooo major kudos!","10068":"Awesome place. Found a great wall ornament and friendly staff makes it worth the drive.","10069":"Had almost a 2-hour layover during dinner hours and saw this place near my gate. The comfortable looking lay-z-boy esque chairs drew me in. I ended up ordering the Grilled Chicken sandwich and opted to go with the House Salad instead of the Fries.\n\nThe brioche bun was nicely toasted and had great texture. The chicken was pretty good despite it's odd, circular shape. The tomato, red onions, and shredded iceberg lettuce added some freshness to the sandwich. The salad was fresh and crisp, but very average. It looked just like the sandwich toppings, but in a bowl. The service, not the food, is what really made this a 4-star worthy experience. I sat there for over an hour leisurely eating while I waited for my next flight. She was great -- friendly, attentive, and didn't appear to mind that I took my time... but it's an airport so she probably sees that all the time.\n\nAverage airport prices for food -- $10-$15 for most of the items. My sandwich and salad was $9.95 plus tip. So it's what you would normally pay for a chicken sandwich and salad at most sit-down restaurants. A nice find that I would probably return to if I have another long layover here.","10070":"Took my mom and brother to check out this new spot by guy fieri. Really nice spot but things weren't exactly working smooth. They had just opened 10 days prior so I'll blame it in having to get all the kinks out. I ordered the dipping sandwhich which had extremely hard bread and was piled on way too high making it impossible to even dip. Not good. However my brother ordered the Mac and cheese hamburger which was amazing...as well as the churros we had for dessert. They messed up on the bill big time so they are going to comp my meal next time. Hopefully it's a lot better.\n\n-Joe","10071":"The pizza was made to order and delicious but by far the strawberry margarita was fabulous. Great lunch for everyone in our party.","10072":"The owner didn't seem very enthusatic as an person. He showed a little confident in his food but when I actually got to taste it and try it. I didn't agree with him. I ordered the chicken parmigiana  sub as an take out. it didn't wow me at all. Super thick bread and bland chicken and sauce. For an establishment that tries to seem like an hole in the wall Italian restaurant I wasn't convinced at all. Even though I never tried the pizza or anything else. But first impressions are everything to me. Nice try but new energy and food is needed.","10073":"My first review on Yelp so here it goes... \nThe food is good and close to home. They are open late AND deliver. I love their chicken wings and all the food is reasonably priced, good deals but the Customer service is HORRIBLE! That is why I decided to start yelping lol The Woman who works here is so rude. So if it wasn't for that I would probably give 5 stars.","10074":"Es un buen lugar, pero realmente el d\u00c3\u00ada que seleccionen ir tienen que mirar quien se va a presentar por que todos los d\u00c3\u00adas no son los mejores artistas. Yo no ten\u00c3\u00ada opci\u00c3\u00b3n por qu\u00c3\u00a9 m voy ma\u00c3\u00b1ana de Montreal pero desde el primer d\u00c3\u00ada puede revisar que hay. La comida rica pero un poco fr\u00c3\u00ada y el lugar de que me sent\u00c3\u00a9 no ten\u00c3\u00ada un buen sistema de calefacci\u00c3\u00b3n as\u00c3\u00ad que mejor hacerse en la parte de adelante. El servicio bueno.","10075":"I spent two nights at this particular Hampton Inn, which is located just a few blocks south of Scottsdale Rd and Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd. I didn't use much of the hotel amenities as all I needed was a place to sleep while plumbing repairs were being performed at my home. I found it to be very pleasant and the staff to be very friendly. The inn was very clean and looked like it was a fairly new building. As I first walked into my room, the very first thing I noticed was how wonderful the room smelled and how clean everything looked. The room I resided in had a television, microwave, small refrigerator, coffee pot with complimentary coffee along with typical condiments, a desk, and an individual HVAC unit attached to the wall. My room also included a bathroom with the usual clean towels, shampoo, conditioner, and soap. The facility also offers free Wifi with your last name and room number as your access code. My surroundings weren't loud so I slept well except for the fact that I went to bed late and had to get up for work the following morning. One other additional amenity I partook in was the complimentary breakfast; specifically, I opted for the breakfast on the go, which consisted of a brown bag with bottle of water, muffin, apple, fruit bar, and mints.\n\nThe location this Hampton Inn is situated in is pretty ideal as it is about a 7 or 8 mile drive away from the shopping, clubs, and fine dining of Downtown Scottsdale. \nThe shopping and fine dining is also just a hop, skip, and jump away within the immediate area. This is also an ideal spot for out-of-towners visiting to attend the Barrett-Jackson auction and Phoenix Open Golf Tournament that occur within the area in late January and early February. All-in-all, I highly recommend the Hampton Inn & Suites located in North Scottsdale for out-of-state visitors and anyone forced out of their home due to property damage.","10076":"Gord, Trish and I had supper this evening at Burrito Boyz.  I've been to their old location lots of times but it's the first time I've been to the new one, which is a couple doors from the old one.\n\nTrish ordered a small vegan burrito and said it was good.  Gord and I ordered small chicken burritos.  In mine, I got chicken, tomatoes, corn, two types of beans, rice, cheese, salsa and burrito sauce.  As always, it was delicious!  Yum!","10077":"This place was a treasure in a corner. I had the beef entree from the recommendation of Arman. I got half rice and half salad and there was plenty of food and came with a half of a pita. I would definitely recommend and will return.","10078":"My husband and I had been wanting to check out the Crepe Bar for about a year but kept forgetting to go. We were so blown away by our first experience and can't wait to go back! Everyone was so friendly and the food was delicious. Looks can be deceiving from the outside, this place is a gem!","10079":"very good place to live...only problem when they allowed dogs but we are well pleased  and have lived here more than 10 years. pierre","10080":"All the sads. I used to LOVE this buffet. But over the years it has gone down hill; not very fresh, not very tasty, not much to choose from. Yet, the price is still up there. I was severely disappointed and won't be returning.","10081":"- There are various sizes, I got the $13 yardstick.\n- Flavors are mixable: I liked the 44 octane and mango. Ask for samples :)\n- Go for the extra shot ($1 for house liquor, $3 for premium?)!\n- You can get refills at a discount, make sure to snag a $1 off coupon too! Keep the cup, and take it with you all weekend - some buffets will allow you to take it in. \n- 6 locations: Caesar's, Mandalay, MGM, Planet Hollywood, Imperial Palace, Stratosphere.","10082":"I've driven by the place so many times always wanting to try it and I'm glad I did. I ordered two large pizzas one pepperoni and the other half chicken and half cheese, as well as 6 piece bone in honey bbq wins. The store was very spacious and clean. The employees were all friendly. As for the food it was delicious. It all tasted fresh and real. The wings were definitely award wining wings. This is my pizza place for now on. In all honesty try this place it was amazing.","10083":"First off, love Wild Thaiger, food is excellent, service is by in large prompt, courteous, and a relaxed atmosphere. \n\nHowever, I had a bad experience, where I witnessed a cockroach walking across the bar in front of me. I voiced my concern to Ola, she couldn't find it. But apologized. I was dissatisfied with this response and wrote her an email expressing my concerns. This is her appropriate, professional abbreviated response.\n\n\"As a regular you know we have an \"A\" rating because we don't have a pest problem.  I will be glad to share the pest inspection reports and monthly service schedule for the last eight years which we have been in business.  It would be a perfect world if I could afford to have enough staff to open all of our boxes in the parking lot and stock all of our products individually to ensure that unwanted pests do not enter our doors. Of course we have discontinued purchasing product from the supplier and they are aware of the problem.\"\n\nShe refunded my money, and we're satisfied, moved on. \n\nI show up today with my party---and she pulls me out of the restaurant, tells me that \"i'm not supporting her business\" and that a few days after my email she gets an inspection from the Maricopa County Health Department, and they gave her a \"B\" rating. She proceeds to accuse me of calling them, and blaming me for her low grade. I inform her that I dealt with her straight, communicated directly with her, and I considered it resolved. At this point she tells me she won't serve me anymore after being a customer for about seven years.\n\nHaving never dealt with the Maricopa Environmental Services, I'm not really aware with how they schedule their inspections but clearly it was a coincidence that it occurred 6 days later. I guess Ola never thought perhaps it was a different customer, or in fact that maybe it was scheduled every 3 months?\n\nAt any rate her reaction to customer feedback is not only unprofessional but just makes bad business sense. \n\nPoor decision Ola, I'm really surprised your sanitation problem, and failing an inspection is blamed on your customers.","10084":"The cupcakes were itty bitty and tasted like nothing special. Betty Crocker woulda been better! $4.25 per cupcake too. Go to Bouchon at the Venetian! The cupcakes are twice the size and a whole dollar cheaper.","10085":"Great local bike shop, with something for everyone, and even some food (sandwiches and baked goods)!","10086":"Service was exceptional.   The food was also wonderful.  I ordered the filet and it was tender and juicy.  My friend ordered the NY and I found it a bit chewy and with more fat,  it that's how he liked it.  Loved the bake potato.  Cooked perfectly. Dinner for two was $150 which was a bit on the high side.  They also have a good brunch on Sunday.  It's again a bit pricey.  $30.   However the place is nice and service is great.","10087":"I had to wait and hour for 777 towing only for their driver to drive off because my keys were left in my aunts car but I gave them my car information because it's my car so ultimately I had the ticket reassigned to my aunts car but before I could do so their driver drove off it only took 5 minutes to have it reassigned to her car. I cancelled their dispatch and had them assign it to phenomenal towing Adam was very kind and sweet when he arrived. He helped me in no time and got to me in less than 45 minutes thank you Adam for being so kind and helpful you're the G.O.A.T!!!!!!","10088":"Coconut chocolate chunk is amazing. Peppermint chip also rocks. They aren't kidding with their use of chocolate pieces. The ice cream is high quality and they do have some interesting flavors. I'm a big fan of Ben and Jerry's, but if you are looking for something a little simpler, this is a good option. There are plenty of tables (and benches outside) to hang out here, or you can grab a pint to go. It does get very busy in the summer, but the line moves quickly. If it were a bit less expensive, I would give it 5 stars. \n\nBy the way, last time I checked you can find Mitchell's at the nearby Heinens as well.","10089":"The Food: \nI ordered the cheese garlic knots for an appetizer. They were delicious and they were very generous with the cheese. They were small but you get six of them.\n\nFor the main course, I shared a slice of white pizza, a slice of sicilian white pizza with spinach and sausage, and a large pizza calzone. The white pizza was simple and delicious. The sicilian slice was perfectly crispy\/crunchy, probably my favorite part of the meal. The calzone was extremely generous with cheese, I'm big on cheese so I loved it.  (10\/10)\n\nThe Dessert:\nI had the pleasure of trying the zeppolis. They were fresh baked and tasted doughy (in a good way), with a light sweetness to them. I recommend them if you don't want to eat something too sweet, great quality. (9\/10)\n\nThe Service:\nThe owners were very friendly and welcoming. They ask for your name and remember it throughout your visit. Since it was our first time visiting, the garlic knots were free. The food we wanted was made from scratch, so naturally we had to wait it. There was a small mishap in the kitchen and they had to remake our food. They let us know the situation in a friendly manner. After trying the appetizer and the white pizza we decided it was worth the wait so we were patient. They gave us some zeppolis as compensation. Accidents happen, and they did a great job of making up for it! (10\/10)\n\nThe Atmosphere:\nLoved the music, they had oldies playing. The place was dimly lit and had an intimate feel. It was quiet and calm. You order at the front counter, but other than that it is a good sit-down place. (7\/10)","10090":"Stay away!  Rip off artists.  \n\nI had them come to give me an estimate on some plumbing work.  The guy put on quite a show hemming and hawing.  Then going out to \"call his boss\" before coming in and giving me an estimate 5 times higher then what I got the work done for by a legitimate plumber.   I don't know how these people sleep at night.","10091":"I have given this place 3 chances and it still disappoints me. The food is subpar, the ambiance is terrible and the servers are rude. \n\nI was there a few weeks back and my friends and I after a night out were reminiscing and our waitress was the biggest snob listening into our conversation and giving her opinion.  She was rude enough to the point we almost walked out before our food, after a 45 minute wait, was even served. \n\nThis place won't last long in old town. With mediocre food at best, slow service and rude employees there are too many other great spots in old town people will venture to.","10092":"Yesterday was the Unblurred or First Fridays on Penn. After watching the weather all day we decided, \"Hooray, no rain\", and made our way out into the neighborhood. After walking up and down Penn Ave and seeing some great art and listening to some music we needed some food. There are not a ton of places to eat up on Penn Ave, but the ones that are there are always so good that it makes it hard to pick one. I for one have never been to Apteka and have been eyeing it up for some time. Since we were close and it was an easy walk I was able to get us to go there. Right when we walked in it was busy, but the server told us the food comes out really fast and the turnover for tables is very fast too. By the time we ordered we already had a table, she was not kidding. We asked her opinions on some of the dishes, just because it was a bit overwhelming to look at the wall menu and then the littler menu by the counter. We finally settled on a small plate, two large ones, and a dessert. Very exciting stuff. The decor is simple and very nice. The tables were close together but the diners are friendly and we even chatted a bit with our neighbors to the right. They were long time Apteka customers and had lots of suggestions for the next time we visited. I like places where you feel that the customer base is so nice that it is easier to sit so close because it is friendly. \n\nSmall Plates: \nBoczniaki z kapusta: oyster mushroom + braised cabbage in beer broth + butternut miso + rye crumb. OK. This was our favorite dish out of all the ones that we tried. My goodness. The butternut miso was fantastic. It was so good that we dipped some pierogies in in, some of our other bread in it, and just scrapped the plate. It was a really nice mix of flavors and blended so well. I would get this again for sure. \n\nBig Plates:\nPierogi: Z kapusta i grzybami \/ seler z jablkiem i ziemniakami i chrzanem: Sauerkraut + mushroom . Celeriac + apple + potato + horseradish. Honestly, I did not like all of the flavors of the pierogies as much as I expected too. I think that the sauerkraut and mushroom was the only one that I really truly liked. It came with a side of greens, some turnips, and I believe some crushed nuts. The greens were fantastic, the turnips were good, and the pierogies, they were ok. I liked the dough, I liked the presentation, I would have just preferred the one flavor over any of the others. \n\nSpecial Sandwich: Veg pate + smoked apple and chilis + red cabbage slaw + salt pickled turnip + savory sauce. This was my dish and I really enjoyed it. I would have liked a bit more of the savory sauce because it was so good! I think that it was the smoked apple, but wowza, what an amazing flavor. Next time I would ask for the sandwich to be cut in half. I had a hard time cutting it and it was a bit bigger so it was easier to handle in two pieces. But because of the fresh bread and only having a butter knife it was a little messy to cut into two. I thought that the veg pate, something that I have never tried or thought about was really great. I was surprised how much I really enjoyed this meal. \n\nDessert:\nTarta jablkowa: Tarta jablkowa z sosem z suszonych owocow. Apple tart + dried fruit compote. Again. YUM. This was a nice end to the meal for sure. The tart was crisp and the fruit on the top was delicious. I enjoyed the little drizzle of fruit something on it too. I would suggest ending the meal with this treat. \n\nThe place was beautiful, the service was fast and friendly, and the food was great. I cannot wait to come back. I am so happy to be able to come here on such a fun Friday night. It really made the start of the weekend so much better.","10093":"Technician arrived promptly and resolved my plumbing problem. The service took two visits to complete because they needed to order the necessary parts for my faucets, however the parts arrived very quickly and they were able to schedule me for same day service on the second visit.","10094":"Excellent place to hang out with a cup of coffee when out for a walk or on your way back home when ur tired and drained out \nSuperb coffee with awesome bagels with cream cheese and of course not to miss the carrot muffin\nCan pick up great sandwiches and salads here too\nIn love with this place \nI come here sit with ahot or cold coffee close ur eyes and sip it \nBliss !!","10095":"Ok .... I'm a hard guy to please when dining out. More often than not I come home disappointed. This place has AWESOME food there is no disputing this. The rating is that high for a reason. Im not going to rant about the food, I'm sure enough people have done that already. What else can you say? I will however rant about the staff. From Management to the Servers, to the Cooks ( whom by the way should be called Chefs) All we're above friendly, Very helpful, patient (my first time..from NJ..live here now) all looked after each other's customers #STRONGTEAM, and the attention to detail was that of a fine dining level. NOT that it's a super fancy place, that's not what I'm saying. I sat at the bar far two seats to the right. Right in front of me was the Window where the Chefs put the food up.I saw food thrown away because it sat a little to long and wasn't to temp therefore , not up to the standards for their customers. I saw the small blonde lady climb to communicate and check the food, literally Lift eggs to make sure they were cooked properly. I even saw a cook pick out a single piece of potato because it was charred. WHO DOES THAT IN A BREAKFAST JOINT...I'm just blown away by all the happy employees working hard and working efficiently together for one reason... make the customers happy. As a Team leader in a Henderson Ford dealership who Ironically has a diner in it, I applaud you all for #1 probably the best meal I have had in Vegas yet. #2 Making the beginning of my day a great one...problem is... I now could never go to another place for breakfasted lunch. \nThank you\nTom","10096":"When you enter a restaurant and it has a greasy smell, LEAVE!  Today's breakfast was very greasy, likely a grill that need a good cleaning and the oil smelled like it needed changing.  I'll never return.","10097":"Best brunch ever? Best Brunch ever! \n\nAnd I can't say that lightly as we love brunch and have been to some of the top places in the top cities for brunch.\n\nBasically the deal here is you play a flat amount (like $40) and they serve unlimited small plates. Options range from Benedicts to Chilaquiles to Chicken and Waffles to Shrimp and Grits. I will be real in that I tried almost everything and loved everything I tried! \n\nThe big standouts were the Chicken and Waffles, Steak and Eggs, and Chilaquiles. They also gave us a guava empanada which was not on the menu but was awesome! \n\nMy pro tip: when ordering don't have everyone get the same thing. Mix and match and share! Otherwise you will fill up fast! \n\nOther pro tip: make a reservation. We got there at 11am which was a tad early for brunch there but by 1pm it was packed in there!","10098":"This Pizza Hut used to offer buffets at lunch time (not sure if they still do), and although it sounds like good, clean pizza fun for $12 or so, it isn't. For whatever reason, Pizza Hut feels they don't have to make quality pizza for the buffet. They don't put as many toppings on and the crust seems to be made of cardboard. There's also a weird chemical taste, which troubles me.\n\nAnyway, they guys have to smarten up. Even their expensive pizza isn't as good as it used to be (skimping on ingredients again). I think a lot of people have already given up on the place and I have too.","10099":"Some of the best\/freshest Italian food I've ever had. Every bite was scrumptious. I appreciated that the menu was simple and straightforward, not too many choices but just enough to have options. My mom got the pappardelle which had the perfect blend of flavors and melt-in-your-mouth freshly made pasta. I had the Sonny Boy pizza and I really appreciated the fresh mozzarella - it was the perfect amount and really refreshing. Our food also came out quickly; they literally just whipped it up and sent it out. Can't wait to go back!","10100":"This place  is clean,quiet and really relaxing.  Unlike other foot spas I've gone to. Price is reasonable.  I would come back every week if I could.","10101":"We came here for brunch. The service was pretty slow, but it's fine, we just wanted to get out of the rain. \n\nMost of the servers were not nice, we had fun watching this one girl talk to customers and then turning around and looking pissed off as hell every time. They were all so grumpy!\n\nWe both got eggs benny. They were okay. I felt like the smoked meat one needed more butter or something else to make it interesting after the first couple of bites. The home fries that came with it were really tasty and crispy! We had Caesars too, but they were mostly ice. Guess we should've ordered beer instead.\n\nIf we were desperate we'd come here for a beer and home fries, but it felt like they wanted us out ASAP, even though it was pouring outside.","10102":"Stay away. There are better Jewish deli's just down Summerlin Parkway. I understand that this is just a few days after opening but c'mon what a mess. The place was near empty and it still took 2 hours to get our orders. I don't mean complicated orders either. I mean bowls of Matzoh Ball Soup (should be quick an easy ready-to-go in vats back there), salads (again super easy), and Reuben sandwiches (again slice up some meat and slam it on some bread). They kept apologizing for how long it was taking - but offered no discounts or adjustments to the bills to reflect that apology. Also FYI the Reuben is like a $20 plate - and bland! Do yourself a favor and skip this place.","10103":"Not all restaurant reboots are successful but Avenue Bar seems to be one of the fortunate few. \n\nAs someone who loved the old school wood paneling, original furniture and supper club fare, it was a bit of a shock to step foot into the bright, mid century modern designed space with cool earth tones and new cream colored leather booths. \n\nThe menu has undergone a considerable makeover (e.g. oysters and carpaccio) and we happened to dine during their Sunday Chicken and Champagne (mind blown), which is case in point that this is not your dad's Avenue Bar. \n\nAlso the staff has been overhauled with the median age 25--they're all friendly and attentive, seemingly at home here or in an Eddie Bauer catalog. \n\nCheese curds were ordered -- they're definitely bigger and seasoned differently than the old recipe but it's a flavorful upgrade that was approved by the table. Brandy old fashions were still well made with a strong pour and classic garnishes. \n\nThe chefs kindly accommodated our request and made deep fried walleye (typically reserved only for Friday), which came with fries (average) and cole slaw (above average with a nice vinegar and sweet balance). The 4-piece fried chicken was light and crispy, the oil was definitely fresh. The side of green beans were also a bright spot, well\nblanched and lightly oiled and salted, which complemented everyone's entree. \n\nWell done Food Fight, well done.","10104":"I simply love this place. My daughters and I went there after my youngest spotted it while shopping. Let me start with the meat... It's fresh ground beef and hand shaped on the grill. The quality is superb let's move on too the bread is freshly baked. I love the mooyah sauce and sweet potato fries were the best. I go there after time I want a great burger. Its better then bang bang....","10105":"I've been to the Morton's in the Biltmore area several times and just loved it. Perfect every time. So when the boyfriend's mom wanted a steak dinner for Mother's Day of course our first choice was Morton's. Although we shouldn't have strayed from the Biltmore location.\n\nI'm surprised people are saying the food here is not good. I think it's really good. I'm giving this Morton's 4 stars because every bit of our food was delicious. Their shrimp appetizer is the best shrimp I've ever had, their filet mignon is always cooked to perfection and if you add their sauteed mushrooms to it, it is simply divine. We also indulged in their chocolate cake which is always very tasty.\n\nThe reason I'm only giving 4 stars and not 5 is because of the service we got. From the very beginning our server seemed distracted and rushed. When she was giving the presentation she kept looking away like there was something more interesting going on somewhere else. I know you have the script memorized but that is just rude. Look at us when you're talking to us! Throughout the meal she would race by and walk away before we could even answer if \"everything was okay.\" I was very disappointed in her lack of attention.\n\nThis location also feels much more casual than Biltmore's. I guess I'm old fashioned but when I go out for a steak dinner I get dressed up. Many people here were in khaki shorts and polos.\n\nNext time we're craving a Morton's steak, we'll be heading back to the Biltmore location where they know how to give excellent service, every time.","10106":"One of the better hamburger joints in phoenix. I always make the mistake of ordering the 1\/2 lb with cheese which is way more than i can eat. The Onion rings are delicious!","10107":"Just want to drop a note, not sure when they started, but new dinner menu for Sakana, as great as always :)","10108":"Not bad. A little too much chocolate in my Mocha but a welcome break from the endless Starbucks on literally every corner in NYNY","10109":"I have taken my dog to this Camp Bow Wow since we moved to town a year ago. They have been great to deal with and always recognize our dog when we arrive. Our dog loves to visit Camp weather it is for day camp or overnight. We will continue to use their services.","10110":"The worst service of all McDonald's places I've ever been!! Gave me a wrong order and won't apologize.","10111":"Awesome food. Don't sit close to the kitchen like we did. You can see everything they are making and we over ordered because it all looked so great.","10112":"I honestly have not had the same problems as everyone else at the Maryland location. I've bought two sectionals from them and my oldest one (had for two years now) is still in the best shape. The price was a great deal considering my boyfriend and I have gone all over to get a large sectional that wasn't $4,000. The only reason why I put four stars because the salesmen are super aggressive--it's really annoying. It got to the point where we told them to let us look on our own. The shipping and set up fee can be avoided by asking another friend for help! We rented a uhaul for a couple hours a did the moving in our own. What's $50? V the $100+ they charge.","10113":"Looking for vintage fashion? This is the place to go! They have dressed many celebrities and from personal experience, they have dressed me also haha. Prices are not cheap, but it's the price you pay for vintage items. The staff is awesome and helpful. Looking forward to do some shopping here again soon!","10114":"Pretty awesome place to grab some beers and just hang out.\n\nThe patio was a great place to just chill with some friends.  Parking is enormous.  Bartenders friendly.  Prices reasonable.  Indoors has a nice ambiance to it and looks like a place that could be a staple if I lived nearby.\n\nSpecial shout-out to Tyber for sponsoring our kickball team--Drinkers with Kicking Problems!  Okay, you get your fifth star...bribery works.\n\ndmo out","10115":"This place brings back great memories. Of youth, fun and friends. A few weeks ago, I decided I wanted to eat here again. I had not done so in years (more then 5, less then 10). I took a new friend and ordered my old favorite, House Special Chicken. It was just as I remembered it. Crispy fried outside, sitting in a ginger and garlic sauce (I love it when food in a sauce is still crisp). My friend approved of her Sesame Chicken but I didn't try any of it, myself. \n\nOne bite took me back 11 years. To a very young man of 19 and his friends. Just coming back from a California road trip and stopping at their then favorite eatery. Ordering our favorite dishes, annoying the proprietor with our laughter and naive inconsideration (we didn't know better back then). Coincidentally, I bumped into one of these old friends there, this trip. \n\nI wondered whether the dish was good because of the memories or because it was just, legitimately, good. So a few weeks later I asked if my parents would let me treat them to Chinese. Bo Bo Chicken, Yu Shuan Chicken & House Special were ordered. The Bo Bo was tasty. I wish it were spicier (as purported) but understand that not everyone has a Chicano mouth like mine. It kind of reminded me of Ramen noodles, the instant kind. I love Ramen. The Yu Shuan was good too. Meat was dark so it was juicy and flavorful but was also supposed to be spicy and was not. House Special was great, again. \n\nWhat did the critics say? \"It all really good, mijo.\" Success. \n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this place if you want the takeout variety of Chinese food. I recommend Nee House more so overall but for tasty, stick-to-your-ribs, let's-get-Chinese-and-watch-a-movie Chinese food, Dragon Palace is hard to beat. The dark, quiet atmosphere and great service of the place is a big plus to me too, so I say, eat-in if you can.","10116":"Great experience and since I bought my dress I keep recommending this place to everyone! \nKalina was super helpful and experience, she understood right away the style I wanted and presented me with few dresses that match it: the second one was it! I tried some more on but that second dress was the one I loved! I would have never imagined to go for a brand but I did and for a price that was way less than any more known cheaper places. Moreover, they helped me in do the fitting at the last moment and everything worked perfectly (I live in California and I came back for my second fitting just three days before my wedding!) The tailor was excellent in her work and I trusted her completely!","10117":"Had a fantastic experience dining at Hy's Steakhouse this past weekend.  We had an early reservation so it was pretty quite during the meal.  The wine list is accessed by a tablet left on the table which allows for several different search options of a very extensive selection.  Without the search options it would be difficult to navigate through to find what we were looking for.  As an appetizer we split the oysters which were amazing.  My favorite part was the fresh shaved horse radish that accompanied the dish.  For our entrees my wife and I both had the bone in Rib Eye medium rare.  We often find that many chefs have difficulty accommodating our customized requests for preparing our steaks but this chef did it perfectly.  We like them prepared Pittsburgh style with a small amount of Bleu or Roquefort cheese melted on top.  They were charred perfectly and still achieved the perfect red medium rare center.  The sides (we had garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms) were delicious as was the creme brulee for dessert.  \n\nLast but definitely not least was the outstanding service.  Our server extremely knowledgeable and friendly and not over bearing at all which I often find in upscale restaurants.  \n\nI definitely recommend this restaurant if you are in the Toronto area, very close to the Royal Alexandra Theatre so great for an after show meal!","10118":"Yardbird is a great restaurant in the Venetian providing some great upscale southern cuisine.\n\nI was sold the moment I saw the fried green tomato BLT online prior to visiting. My initial plan was just to stop in for a few pieces of chicken and some fried green tomatoes but ended up ordering a mini feast for myself. Going through the menu I saw cheddar waffles...CHEDDAR WAFFLES!!! with spiced watermelon and chicken. I'm use to the traditional chicken and waffles so I had to give these waffles a try and I was blown away. DELICIOUS!!! Adding maple syrup to the waffles didn't take away from the cheddar flavor mixing quite well. I glanced at another table and saw the mac and cheese so of course I wasn't leaving without ordering some also.\n\nFunny story for kicks. I came to Yardbird after drinking on the strip with a friend and ended up going into the restaurant next to Yardbird thinking it was Yardbird before realizing it wasn't. Ordered drinks and everything only to have to leave and go next door. This actually gave a couple of staff members who were very nice by the way at Yardbird a good laugh when telling the story.\n\nGlad I finally made it to the correct restaurant and will be paying future visits because those chicken and waffles are awesome.\n\nDinner 2\/12\/2015","10119":"We have just found our new Thai food eatery!  The food was absolutely delicious!  I was in heaven with the first mouthful of their yellow curry with chicken. We also ordered Panang curry with Salmon as well as their BBQ chicken with Papaya salad and sticky rice. My taste buds were in heaven. The flavors of each dish was out of this world!  Even their Thai Tea was a delight to the senses!  Highly recommend this place, our new go to Thai food eatery!","10120":"I generally give every business a fair shake and realize everyone has a bad day but don't waste your money here. I ordered a meatball parm sandwich and what I got was an embarrassment, there was almost no cheese and the meatballs were sliced what seemed to be in quarters but length wise and then laid on the bread, there was almost nothing on this sandwich other than bread! The worst part is it's a $9.00 sandwich, if it was $5 or $6 I would understand and if I worked closer I would have brought it right back. I will say the flavor was ok at best. If you served people sandwiches like this for $9 anywhere in the northeast you wouldn't be in business for long. Either lower your prices for your mediocre sandwiches or up your game to justify the price.","10121":"Absolutely will never go here again, not only is it crowded to the point that people are shoulder to shoulder, but all the staff at the desk are rude and their manger was a complete dick head. I came in when they first opened and was interested for my parents and I. Guy came out gave me a tour and then want to star the paper work. I told him that I gotta talk to my parents first and he made a comment saying;\"your how old and you need to ask mommy and daddy!\" Well let's see my parents WOULD HAVE PAYED, and get the memberships but they where at a dr.appt and asked me to go and see if it's worth it. My parents went a head and got theirs because it was cheap and close to the house. As for me I'll prefer to go to 24 hour where weights can be dropped and I don't need to worry about some roided guy staring at me.","10122":"Take out lunch and grabbed a sammich from Potbelly.. Now, this is my first time here, and wasn't sure what to expect.. Sandwich selections were a little different, and definitely not the cookie cutter sammich shop. \n\nI opted for \"A Wreck\" and added mayo, lettuce, onion, and pickle. \n\nThe bread toasted was VERY Good, nice flavor n texture, and all the \"Wreck\" ingredients were fresh.. The sammich is in my top 5 for east valley for sure now. \n\nDine In area was very well organized, and clean. The staff were all attentive from my time there.. \n\nWhy 4 Stars and not 5 ? Well, I wouldn't Drive Out of my way to get a sammich, except from one other place.. Now this could change after I validate the consistency and try a few more sammiches.. \n\nYes, I WILL be back in the next week or 2. cheers","10123":"Bought Macaroons.  Pricey at $2.99 each with no discounts for half dozen or dozen but really good. Really really good.","10124":"I just went in here to fix my daughter ipad and it was both the glass and the digitizer that needed repair. It cost me 85.00 + tax and my son had tp pay most of it.","10125":"LV.Net is without a doubt the superior choice in high-speed internet!! \nMy only con is that I wish I had known about them sooner! After years of frustration with both Cox and Century Link, I thought sub-standard internet service, terrible customer service, and ever-increasing monthly bills were my inescapable fate.\nDuring my initial inquiry call, I was provided a thorough explanation of the services provided, along with pricing, and was able to schedule my installation that same week. The technicians sent were true professionals and worked diligently to have my internet up and running in a short amount of time. \nIt's been five months now since upgrading to LV.Net and my internet has never been better.  I can easily say it's been five months of dependable and reliable service! My teenage son is also a gamer, so the switch to LV.Net has been a real game changer for him, his days of lag and limited connection are thankfully long gone.\nThe purpose of my review is to assure people that there is a better option for their internet needs! LV.Net is a locally owned and operated business which means when you call their customer service you get to talk to a real person in town!!! Not an automated machine, or a representative outsourced from another country, which is personally quite refreshing. \nWe are living in a time of technology, and unlike my past providers, this company has demonstrated that they are ahead of the curve! I do the majority of my work from home, and being able to have a dependable internet connection with unrivaled upload & download speeds is life changing!","10126":"I finally stopped in! It was a long time coming,being that I had heard so much about this place that had about every flavor of popcorn one could imagine.\nYep, they do.I got 3 mini bags to try: Cornfetti, Scottsdale blend & Sonoran blend.Tasty , accurate flavors and big puffy kernels.All consumed by the end of the day.\nThey have seasonal flavors and sell an array of popcorn acutrimon as well.\nI'm planning on being a regular.","10127":"Went with seven work colleagues for a birthday lunch for the boss. Our group mainly had the Biloxi sandwich, daily special, grilled cheese or street tacos. Save room for dessert and share the \"Brookie\" like I did! Dont forget to sign something cute in the book :)","10128":"Very good customer service, excellent food. They're bbq chicken pizza is bomb.com","10129":"I don't mind the Earl's chain, the menu items always entice me and they are reasonably priced for what you get. I decided to have lunch here while working downtown as LOCAL was completely full. Surprisingly, we were greeted by two friendly hostesses and our server that afternoon was very friendly and attentive.\n\nWe ordered my favourite appie, the Dynamite Rolls, and they were delicious! No complaints there. I also went with the Tortilla Soup and the Chicken Caesar Salad, both were quite good and very generous portions. Based on the poor reviews, I was expecting a lackluster meal, but I was actually impressed and we were in and out within the hour. I may just give this Earl's another try next time I am dining DT.","10130":"Best juice in town! Love all the variety that you can chose from. The beet junkie is my fave","10131":"My first visit to Ru San's was last Monday and I've already been back a second time! this place is awesome. I love the laid back vibe and the food is on point.\n \nBoth times I went, I ordered the Kiss of Fire roll and it was delicious. I also tried the crabcake and miso soup - also great. As a sushi fan, this is some of the best I've tried in Charlotte. The only drawback is that the service isn't super great but it's worth overlooking for the delicious food. I can't wait to go back and try more rolls! This is definitely going into my regular restaurant rotation.","10132":"Food was great. Very fresh and well priced. Staff is amazing and willing to accommodate you.","10133":"Great movie theatre that shows second run films. Tickets are generally $3 each and on Tuesdays admission is only $1.50! I don't know about you, but that's a darn good deal! In addition to all the box office hits, they also on a fairly consistent basis show foreign films. Some of the theatres have been upgraded with reclining leather seats. The rest of the theatres have the old school red cushion style chairs. This is an older theater, there are no stadium seats. However, for the price and for what you get- this is the best deal in town!\n\nThe only thing I wish for would be an occasional early\/mid-morning matinee.. Say about 11 or 11:30 am, so I'd have time to go before work. \n\nThe restrooms are always clean, staff is always friendly, and the decor is outdated (think 1990's). Although, I cannot comment on the food since I've never partook. I would recommend this theater for anyone on a budget, families, singles and friends- anyone really... And I will return!","10134":"We came in this weekend and at at the bar\nFor 20min. No on\nEven made eye contact with us. But I gave\nThem the benefit, there were 4 of us so we were visible. We went upstairs to tilted kilt","10135":"Dr. Rob DiVito is the BEST in Scottsdale! He and his staff are extremely professional, caring, and fantastic at what they do! I had a very difficult time finding a good dentist in the area since moving here from New York and had some traumatic experiences in the process. After many years of searching, I finally found this incredible place and I am beyond happy and thankful. I highly recommend this practice- you won't find a better dental team in the area.","10136":"Love this nail salon. I happened to find this place since it's across the street from my kids preschool. I have been getting the SNS manicure. It's better than gel, last twice as long and it has made my nails longer and healthier. The SNS lasts 3-4 weeks and they still look great. Could last longer except the growth is what finally gets me in to have them re-done. I have never once had a nail chip, lift or break. Definitely worth trying if you are tired of getting gel nails every 2 weeks and gel always lifting and coming up","10137":"I seriously can not get enough of this place. Every time we go to Vegas I have to go here. What you get for the price is just awesome.  I don't know how they are not busier. Yea you can go to a lot of other places and pay twice the price and still not get as good of choices as you can here. \n\nYou get bottomless mimosas, plus a wide variety of food. Theres crab, asian, mexican, bbq, pho, and almost anything else your heart desires. This time I brought a friend that is vegan and she was still able to eat like a queen.  The dessert station gets better and better every time we go there. The thing that is a little troublesome is that the plates are always too hot at the dessert station, so all my chocolate melts before I get it to the table. I also think having an Ice Cream station would be super cool too! \n\nOverall though you have to come here, it's not a super fancy buffet. I am saying for the price though you can't really beat it and I guarantee you will leave feeling full and happy.","10138":"This market is tops on my list. Whenever I stop in Las Vegas we stop here. The prices on the fruits and vegetable is way cheaper than the local supermarkets. Service isn't tops but It's a easy trade for prices. The employees try to make you happy, which is good enough for me. The variety is remarkable. If your cooking an Asian recipe, this has everything and some.","10139":"Oh man! What a treat! \nOf course I ordered the softshell crab sandwich, and obviously upgraded the fries to crab-i-fy (not a real term)!\nIt's an entire softshell crab deep-fried into the sandwich all delicious on great bun and trimmings. The fries with the crab on poutine style is just out of this world! \nIt's not cheap lunch and be warned that you will not be productive at work all afternoon trying to digest I all (portion is huge) but oh so worthy indulgence","10140":"I made an appointment for en elderly client of mine and when we got there, they claimed to not have any record of the appointment. The gal who was supposed to do her pedicure was unavailable and they didn't take into consideration that my client is elderly with limited mobility. I asked when her toes would be dry because I couldn't safely transfer her from the chair she was in with the slippers they put on her and all the lady kept saying to me was that she needed to wear the slippers or her nails would get ruined....This place frustrates me.","10141":"I was a little skeptical at first because this place is located inside a Walmart but I gave it a chance because of the price. Now, this has become my favorite spot in Vegas. I don't trust anyone with my eyebrows except for Sid now. He's quick, gentle, and knowledgeable. I think he's also the only one who does threading at this location.","10142":"Great place I meant one of the owners best place to get medical marijuana staff is friendly and very professional","10143":"This guy Vic is hilarious! Just an added bonus to his very innovative menu of hotdogs and brats.  Maybe not the best place for the faint of heart as the Chili man speaks freely (very freely) and doesn't really give a s***.  I got he the Chili Man's choice and vinegar bomb, chips and a drink all for under $8 and was very pleased with my meal.  Only down side I can think of here is that his lines get really really long so try to get there before noon on nice days.  Other than that its just something you gotta try if you're in Uptown.  Nothing more to say but I will be back!","10144":"After one month trouble with the unit! But the service has been continuously poor. Now on a Saturday in the heat of Arizona's summer, we had to call numerous times to get someone to call back to tell us they can't come for hours. They need to have service people in the summer!! Now after waiting hours still nobody!!~ With all the companies out there who needs this kind of aggravation after spending 8000.00. They have since fired the installers who were so terrible and made good on everything!!!","10145":"Food was good, not great.   But we were I. Mood for BBQ.     Mac and cheese was pretty bland and the slaw wasn't worth the calories.   Potato salad was good (fill based) and beans were plain, not very saucy.   Brisket was good, pulled pork was good .","10146":"I love the popcorn here the best flavors are the churro and kettle and a lot of other amazing flavors!! The people are always nice and friendly :)","10147":"I recently moved back to Scottsdale and was looking for a new esthetician. I did a little research online and came across Celebrity Skin. They have impeccable reviews with multiple satisfied customers, so I decided to schedule an appointment. Just to clarify, there are two Jennifers so it can get a bit confusing. Jennifer S. (the owner), and Jennifer F. Jennifer F was available on the day and time that was convenient for me so I decided to schedule with her. I could not be happier with the service! She was so meticulous, knowledgable and took time to understand my skins needs and concerns. I'm so happy it only took me one attempt to find my new esthetician.","10148":"Disgusting! Felt like I was on Fear Factor, except I paid to eat there.  Everything was funky.....taste, smell, texture. Wished I read Yelp before ordering.  Even the white rice was really odd.  Can't put my finger on it, but it was like extra dense and just strange.  Have never had a Chinese place mess up white rice.  Shrimp toast was oddly large, burnt, smelly and can't imagine what decade the shrimp was from.  Teriyaki sticks could have been squirrel.  So gross, threw out most of it. Oh, and it took an hour and a half. Would not eat here for free! At least I did not get maggots like a previous poster.... I think?? God help me tomorrow.","10149":"I frequent Vegas buffets and I got to say I was pretty disappointed at this one. The food quality was pretty poor","10150":"The Food Fight group never disappoints, and Monty's Blue Plate Diner is no exception. We loved the extensive brunch menu here. We did have to wait around 20 minutes, but there's some nice outdoor dining space and so we didn't mind waiting outside in the warm weather. Once we were seating, the waiter was extremely efficient. Our orders were taken right away and we probably didn't wait more than 10 minutes for our food. They have a large variety of brunch choices. The bloody marys come with a side car of beer as well. The booths were cozy and overall felt like old fashion diner. Would definitely visit again!","10151":"We make sure to visit Melt every time we visit Cleveland. Even though there are so many delicious grilled cheeses on the menu, I almost always get the chorizo & potatoes which is by far the best thing on the menu. This time I tried the buffalo chicken which was also very good. My mom & cousin had the combo where you got soup, salad and half a sandwich for $9, which is a great value. The buffalo chicken soup was good but crazy spicy. The melt salad was amazing. If you love grilled cheese & haven't been here you have to try it. So good!","10152":"Absolutely amazing! Highly recommend! Outstanding atmosphere and incredible food\/drinks!!","10153":"It's okay, The atmosphere is nice, i thought the way it was set up was really cute,  they have a very pretty tree with really pretty plates as the foliage. I thought that was neat. As for the food, I wasn't very impressed with the cake, it seemed too...doughy? it's just not what i expect in cake, and it's waaaayy too sweet. To be honest, the thing that i will come back for is the Chocolate pot de creme, it's like a dark chocolate creme, with whipped topping. It's amazingly delicious. The service was great, the girl there was very courteous and whenever we needed something, she definitely helped. I want to give this place a higher rating, but i just didn't like most of the stuff they had so i can't.","10154":"We waited over an hour for our three cheeseburgers even though the restaurant was nearly empty.  When the food arrived the burgers were cold and my kids didn't even have cheese on their burgers . They took them away and took ten minutes to add and melt the cheese.  The burgers were inedible at that point.  They chose to \"comp\" our sodas as an apology.  Wow.  Thanks for a shit meal and zero apologies for crap service.  Wont go back even if it's a free meal.","10155":"After attending the GNR show, while having had a great time at a fantastic show, I have to admit the arena itself was nothing spectacular.  As a matter of fact, it was pretty standard.  For being in a place like Las Vegas, I would have expected something a little more interesting or themed or just more grand to catch the vibe of the strip.  This venue did the job, acoustics were fine, parking was fine, beer selection was fine, seats were fine...basically everything was just fine.  I guess that is my problem, in Las Vegas, a place where anything goes...it should be more than just \"fine\", it should be larger than life.  Mark missed, simple as that.","10156":"We came in for wine before our Joe Beef reservation - being a wine bar and restaurant owner myself, I was really curious about the list.  The wines by the glass were interesting and it's not always easy to find such delicious natural wines but all 4 that we had were terrific!  We shared 2 small plates too, the dried sausage with smoked cheddar, and the tomato and shrimp salad - both were awesome.  Our server\/bartender Jeanne was excellent, she really knows her wines, super friendly, gave us some great recommendations of which dishes to order at Joe Beef, and when we went to Joe Beef, she sent us a round of a really nice ros\u00c3\u00a8.  Great experience and we'll definitely be back next time we're in Montreal!","10157":"The plumbers were courteous and knowledgeable they had the clog cleared and the leaking shower drain fix in short order and at a reasonable cost.","10158":"First time I have been to J Gumbos and was pleasantly suprised. It has a very good size bar and dining area that I noticed right away even though I did take out. I wish I knew about this place during the freezing Cleveland winter! Friendly staff that offered me some samples of a couple of different options. The only complaint that I have is they need to add a bit more sauce with the rice bowls. Taste was great but got a little bland once I ran out of sauce towards the end even with mixing it up before hand. I will definitely be back to try the other dishes. Overall this place is priced great and worth a try if you like cajun food.","10159":"I had some great ice cream here. As the photos depict, it still comes in a Chinese food box with a fortune cookie tossed in. Fairly low prices, too.","10160":"We try to keep ourselves eating at this place at a max of once a week. We can hardly stand living so close and not eating here daily. \n\nHate hotdogs? You've never tried the frog dog. All hotdogs here are incredible, topped with brisket avacados, close slaw, etc etc the list goes on and on. \n\nThe barbecues are all amazing and make which ever delicious tender meat you try , out of this world. Try the cherry one!","10161":"Horrible customer service, probably worse I've ever had. The cashier didn't say thank you, just handed me my receipt without even looking at me. So I made her hold it till she looked at me, that's when she felt like an idiot.","10162":"So that's why I don't go to Regal.\n\n\nSo we decided to go to this theater for Fathers Day weekend to see the new Incredibles 2 movie and we only chose this theater because the showtime best fit our schedule and it was very convenient seeing as how it's right up the street from our house.\n\nLet's start with how dirty this place is. Popcorn and trash everywhere. And I mean everywhere. Outside, the lobby , the halls . You can't miss it. \nOur concession experience wasn't great and the main reason for my review. We were dealing with someone named Ashlee and then a rude gentlemen named Ryan decided to butt in and start arguing with us about the drink sizes and refills. When I tried to ask him a question he literally just walked away and decided to grab the customer behind me and start helping them instead. Probably the rudest customer service we have ever had. Especially when you are spending a small fortune on carnival food.\n\nThe theater was hot and again dirty but it did its job. However we won't be returning .","10163":"Very impressed! Great theme. Food was really good. We ordered the calamari for the appetizer. The best I have ever had. We had a great pizza which was a happy hour special. Also, had the shrimp\/grits dish. Everyone was pleased with the food and drinks. The most important part of the meal was the server, Ron. He was not only an excellent server( the best I have seen in a long time) but the way he took a genuine interest in us was amazing. He was so attentive and just made us feel so special. We were all very impressed with this young man.  Ask for him you won't be sorry!","10164":"3.9\/5 I'm a fan because:\n\n1. i love buffets\n2. i love seafood & the mussels here kicked ass!\n3. all  my friends chowed down on the crab legs so it must have been good. i couldn't eat it cold so i skipped that.\n4. over 10 different dessert choices!!!!\n5. cheese cold cuts\n6. nice, clean, interior\n7. waiter was super nice\n\ntips:\n-get it line 1 hr before you want to eat! take turns waiting it line while you gamble!\n-eat in groups of 7 or less. groups of 8 is an automatic 20% gratuity","10165":"Horrific\/non-existent customer service.  Nursery men rude and sexists.  If you want tons of bad attitude and no help, this is your place.  Yesterday I decided to drive the extra mile or two (I'm new to town so pardon lack of distance knowledge) from Lowes to Breezewood (the one across from the Giant Eagle) Nursery.  Night and day difference.  I said to the Breezewood nursery person who gave me loads of tips, instructions and advice that they were so much better in every way from Lowes.  The man replied \"We hear that a lot.\"   \n\nIt showed.  Breezewood was bustling with customers (I was still in and out in 5 minutes including going all the way to the back where the bulk soils etc are).  When I drove past Lowes, it had an almost empty parking lot.  Maybe they stay in business by charging tons for bad work to unsuspecting housewives?  They sure don't like people who ask questions or try to get information.  They just seem to want a customer who keeps their mouth shut and pays whatever the jerks dictate.","10166":"These people are wonderful very caring and very giving and the food was delicious I placed an order at 10 AM in the morning and it was at my door at 10:35 AM great service and I love the prepared meals that they do every night. We are really delicious and reasonably priced","10167":"This is where Boys go to become Men. And this is where Girls go to to become Badass. Owned and operated by World Class Champions. Are the owners of the competition owned and operated by World Class Champions? The answer is NO. This place is legit. It's safe. Master Cuenca is an awesome instructor that is very personable, patient, and firm. I met his wife once, but that's probably because she's too busy winning competitions. Real Heroes need apply.","10168":"Laura was incredible. I bought my house and was delayed in getting it rekeyed. I finally got around to it and she was recommended by my realtor. She came out a few hours after I called and was quick and efficient in changing every lock and making sure I was safe in my home. She took extra measures she didn't have to for my benefit and I am incredibly grateful! \n\nLaura the Lock Lady is an absolute gem in a world that I didn't know much about. And it's nice to see powerhouse women who excel in a male dominated field! Keep on rockin on, Lock Lady!","10169":"Woah woah. Surprised to see all the terrible reviews here. My coworkers and I come here at least once a day as it's close to our work. Staff is almost always friendly and seem like they enjoy each other's company which makes a difference. They've all been there a long time too so there's consistency and recognition. They recently added a fried chicken section so things have gotten a little more chaotic when trying to check out. One line is supposed to be for ordering food and retail and one is just retail but people end up just standing wherever and no one knows who's next. But besides that it's a solid gas station shop with good coffee, decent snacks, and Thrifty Ice Cream! They used to serve Douwe Egberts which was amazing but now they've switched to a thermos system with coffee from different countries which is also good. Mix your coffee with the hot chocolate or vanilla latte for a hint of sweetness :). I have no issues with Short Line Express. They certainly have a swift business going now so you have to be patient but it's worth it.","10170":"One of the few places in Madison to get good tacos at. Definitely the cheapest authentic tacos in the area. The food tastes great, the service is quick and friendly, and the bill won't hurt your wallet too bad.\n\nBe sure to try the green salsa!","10171":"Wow, I had a couple of slices initially and was back a week later for a pizza. I ordered a large deluxe pizza, and like the slices, I was not disappointed. These guys do an awesome pizza and their prices are spot on. My kids, wife and myself really really love Marconi's pizza. Try it you won't be disappointed. I drive 25-minutes to pick up this pizza, well worth it.","10172":"Great location if you can score a seat on the patio but you'll have to fight off the birds.  Inside isn't so bad especially with the AC on.  Our server spoke too fast and seemed hurried the whole time.  The food took FOREVER to come out and I noticed the surrounding patrons around us didn't get food either.  Nothing was coming out of the kitchen, except for drinks for a good 20 mins.\n\nOnce the food arrived, my husband's burger was good.  I got the hash and it was very dry.  The side of fries I got were great though.","10173":"Best cheesesteak in town.  The bread is baked fresh and delivered everyday specifically for the cheesesteaks.  The meat is to die for, thinly sliced right off the eye of round and then fried up in its own fat.  Tell them to lightly toast the bread and you'll have a foodgasm.","10174":"I looooooved living at The Venetian for a weekend. Although I shared the room with 6 smelly boys and 2 lovely girls, I thoroughly enjoyed our suite. The bathroom is gorgeous with two sinks, a separate vanity area, a big tub, and see-thru shower. My only complaint is room service. The morning after a very drunken night, I ordered a bottle of Evian and a bottle of Voss with slices of cucumber to be delivered to my room. The cost? Thirty dollars. That was definitely one expensive hangover.","10175":"Botanical garden was a nice stroll for the family. We took the tram to tree center. They Chinese garden was closed but we saw some of the pretty lantern outside. It was a shame that it was closed. We also went to the Japanese garden but nothing to compared to the Chinese garden. We also liked the insectarium, got to hold a cucaracha.  Saw so many different bug species. The roses and water lilies were beautiful. It was a warm day but they had water fountain everywhere to keep hydrated.","10176":"First you'll notice there is nobody eating inside.which says a lot about the food.\nWent to use a certificate that we got for Christmas,the owner was mad at us instantly,I guess he had a falling out with the company that was selling his certificates.\nI've had the pizza,it's not that good.\nThe owner is a azzhole!\nPlease go elsewhere.","10177":"This was the BEST DAM TOUR EVER! [har-har, get it?]\n\nHonestly, we were all laughing our butts off when our \"dam\" tour guide told us that we were about to embark on the best \"dam\" tour ever! Hoover Dam is quite a piece of work, the video and the turbines and the viewing deck and the whole dam is an engineering masterpiece. More so considering it was constructed in the middle of the Great Depression in the 1930s. Anywho, regurgitating the details of the tour is boring but the tour is not, I highly recommend it. It is totally touristy but a fun tour and one has the best views from the observatory, so it makes for fantastic pictures.","10178":"The decor of my room was amazing!!!! we had a suite and another big room, forgot what its called but its not a normal room!\n\nThe set up of the venetian is so beautiful! I love the design of the room.  brings you back in the days to an elegant prince\/princess scene.  What I love is the window screen where you can adjust it from remote for the perfect lighting.  Bathroom is so nice!!!!! Such a nice hotel!","10179":"The solved and issue I had with my scalp it took a couple of visits but they were able to finally fix it when other places did not have any marked impact on my issue. If they would have fixed after the first time they would have gotten 5\/5 I am a tough grader and the did great. Definitely worth going on a Saturday.","10180":"Today was my first time being in this nail salon all I can say it it was amazing the staff was very nice, called this morning to make an appointment got me right in. I will be going back to this nail salon, I'll be telling my friends to go here from now on.","10181":"Bel endroit \u00c3\u00a0 visiter...les oeuvres changent quand m\u00c3\u00aame assez souvent, mais je trouves cela trop petit. Belle petite d\u00c3\u00a9couverte quand on marche sur Ste-Catherine. Il faut donner une donation de 2$ minimum...\u00c3\u00a7a vaut le coup et si vous donnez plus que 2$ on vous donne un petit cadeau!","10182":"I wish I gave BC a chance in my past as it's been my next door neighbor for 20 years! We came here to head off to the Railroad Museum for the Little Man. And since the historic area is only a quick car drive down Nevada Way we figured why not stop on over. Downtown Boulder City is so quaint and walkable. There are several art sculptures scattered throughout. Be sure to check them out as you walk around. \n\nThere's also a pocketful of shops and diners to keep you occupied. Me and the Hubster are already planning on coming back here again soon sans the Child to check out some of the bars as they looked pretty cool i.e. Dillinger, Milos, and others all lined up. We also wanna check out the DDD-famed The Coffee Cup for breakfast too! We didn't make it in time for lunch :( Another reason why we want to come back!","10183":"Dr Dewan is he best. He's done the work to motivate my daughter to take ownership of her ailment, better than my wife or I ever could have, and I believe when she looks back she'll recognize him as one of the most influential people in her life. It makes such a difference when a doctor develops a relationship with his patient and understands them enough to know how to motivate them. He even took the time to recommend a geometry tutor for my daughter and I think one of the happiest moments of her life was when she completed her first proof! I highly recommend him.","10184":"This shop sells stuff which have already expired. I had a friend working there and he told me not to buy certain stuff like juices ... Very expensive.. Its not worth it\n\nIbneler, o kadar pahali satiyosunuzki, kafanizi sikiyim sizin...","10185":"Overall great experience. Wesley H. Was my service advisor and he was great and kept me informed through the whole process. They told me it'd be ready Friday, they got it done by Wednesday! Only complaint, there were a few bumps in the clear coat that probably only I would notice.","10186":"Came in Friday 10\/24\/14. Got there before it opened because of what I've read on previous yelp reviews. Once we got in I waited for about an hour ,but it was totally worth the wait. I got my cut by Martin. Told him what I wanted even showed him some pics and he nailed it! I've gotten several compliments since. They don't rush it . Will definitely come back soon!","10187":"I decided to stop in during lunch and I'm glad I did.\n\nThe lady at the register greeted me and walked over to me as soon as I walked in the restaurant. \nthe place was definitely clean and the music was relaxing, Definitely a laid back vide.\n\nTheir menu is not too crazy but there's enough to keep you happy and satisfied. It is a little on the pricy end but it's understandable for the type of food that they are providing. \n\nI ordered the Black Bean Burger and a Passion Fruit Green Tea (unsweetened) \n\nOmg let me tell you it tasted amazing. \nThe black bean patty did not taste dry or brittle.\nThe lemon tahini was not over powering and mixed in very good with the whole thing. \nOmg The sweet potato fries were so good and I just wanted more and more. \nThe drink in itself was yummy and very thirst quenching and I'm glad I went with it. Actually did not taste like it was unsweetened but oh well. Haha \n\nThe only down side to this place is the cost but I mean it's kinda understandable. \n\nI would definitely recommend this place to people in the area. I'll be returning at some point to try out some other things on their menu. \nA+ guys\n\nOh also their to go box was very nicely backed in my opinion.","10188":"This is the only place we will take our Portuguese Water Dog to get groomed. Arturo spent time understanding what we wanted and more importantly, what our dog could handle while getting groomed. She doesn't like blow driers so he accommodated her by letting her air dry rather than forcing her to finish sooner. Simple things like this make a huge difference I believe.","10189":"My favourite restaurant. Easily the best value in Yorkville. Unbelievable food. Great ambience. Dimmi has it all. Five motherf***in stars.","10190":"Best Gelato in Vegas. Cool little spot in the new Summerlin downtown mall. There are so many flavors! I like how they do different specials all the time. Favorite so far was the \"True Romance\". Keep that one!","10191":"I ordered sweet and sour pork, pork fried rice, and egg rolls. My compatriot ordered Kung Pao chicken.  We just wanted some descent chinese food delivered to us.  We began with the egg rolls.  They were amazing. Not overly fried and soggy, where you can only taste the grease, like most places.  These were crisp and full of flavor.  \n\nMy sweet and sour pork came delivered naked (sauce on the side).  Which was nice,  i hate it when the meat is soggy.  The rice was different than i expected.  It was light and a little less flavorful than I was hoping.  It was still good, but not compared to the amazing sweet and sour pork.  The sweet and sour sauce was thick and tangy.  Not just bland red syrup.  I put a little on the rice to liven in up a bit.  (Worked)\n\nMy compatriots only complaint with his Kung Pao Chicken was that is was not spicy enough.  I think that they could probably make it spicier next time if requested.  Amazing food, prompt delivery,  will be eating here again.","10192":"Food is good and lots to choose from. I love the custom omelette..!!! Around the world type food, something for everyone..","10193":"Went to Lucky Lou's this Saturday, and it was surprisingly quiet. For a non-steak place, we had a good prime rib dinner with fast and pleasant service. They even welcomed and brought out water for our 120lb dog. We will definitely go back again!","10194":"Every time I come to Vegas I must make a stop at Trader Joe's! Always loading my cart with goodies to bring back home since Hawaii does not have a Trader Joes.\n\nMy all time favorite snacks are: butter almond thins, butter waffle cookies, oatmeal Dunkers, maple leaf cookies, and crunchy peanut butter spread! So delicious!\n\nWorkers are always pleasant and every-time I go the shelves are fully stocked. I'm such a obsessed fan. No product has disappointed me yet!","10195":"One of the best place I have been to for my injuries, beside having really good Physio therapist like Dalyce, Chiropractor Ken and Message therapist Melissa their office staff is very helpful as well they always send reminders for up coming appointments and very prompt with all the email inquiries. Depending on the your insurance company they will process your bills as well.","10196":"I absolutely loved my experience with them! And I love that its mobile that they come to where I'm located to do the spray tan ! My experience was fun and results where great ! Also big thank you to Christina she's great!","10197":"I'm so disappointed.  I usually love this place, the Monte Cristo is my favorite and their white cheddar mac is usually so delicious. \nI just picked up dinner for my husband and I, however,  and they forgot the sauce that makes the sandwich so good - it's advertised as crispy and it was soggy; I'm not going to eat it. They forgot his drink, the bread they used for his sandwich was stale and the macaroni and cheese tastes like they made it yesterday-ish. \n\nI called and they told me they'd refund my credit card for the soda. \n\nThirty bucks down the drain. \n\nI won't be going back.","10198":"Thought I would try this place it's a little farther than my normal Chinese restaurant but I'm very glad I did. All I can say is the food was so much more tasty than the restaurant I normally order from. Very very flavorful. The people also very accommodating and nice. I think I found a new Chinese restaurant.","10199":"Quite possibly the best burritos I've ever had and they cost barely anything. Service is great and they deliver for a min fee","10200":"Fun bar! Had live cover band and DJ Friday night. Drinks are light on alcohol.  But band was entertaining.","10201":"I can't sing higher praises of these guys.  My 30k mile Versa had developed an idling problem.  I took my car in for routine maintenance and asked if they would have a look at the problem.  They performed the routine maintenance I requested and although I was a little bit taken aback by the price for the inspection ($100-$200 based on what they had to do) I have trusted them for quality service on other vehicles.  They did a diagnostic and the problem was a misfire on cylinder 2.  They went out of their way to call my dealership to see if the problem was covered under warranty, which it was.  As it turned out Nissan had to replace my engine.  This mechanic could have chased the problem from sensor to sensor and fuel filter and ignition etc etc but they didn't, they found the correct path for me to save money and get my car running perfect again.  After that Matt who is the friendliest and most helpful person you will EVER meet at a mechanic offered to take my car to the dealership and pick it up for me, free of charge.  He even knocked off most of the inspection charge because they quickly realized they wouldn't be doing the work to repair it.  There are cheaper mechanics out there but the quality of service here not only made my experience much better but ended up saving me potentially thousands of dollars worth of repairs that were ultimately covered under my warranty.\n\nAlthough there is a small premium to get work done here (there are shady mechanics that will do jobs for less) the customer service by itself, let alone the quality of work, honesty and integrity of the staff are well worth the marginal pricing differences.  \n\nKeep up the good work!  Always glad to support local businesses!","10202":"I've been seeing Dr. Garcia for quite a while, and for good reason. She is thorough, efficient and effective. She is an excellent listener and very personable and caring. She makes excellent referrals when specialists are needed. She has always been available for my needs and I feel very fortunate to call her my doctor. \nThe front office staff are professional and friendly. The nurses are also thorough and really go that extra mile. \nAs for the negative review- there are two sides to the story and while I'm sorry that happened to you, good health care requires you bring your own advocate and many times it is necessary to ask questions maybe more than once for clarity.","10203":"The fry bread is AMAZING and the toppings were DELICIOUS!!!!\n\nThe girl taking the orders was not the friendliest though and I had several chewy chips.\n\nRegardless, we will be back at least once a week for sure, and we'll hope the girl is in a better mood next time.","10204":"Probably the largest Asian grocery store in the area:  They have a huge supply of ramen (no, not maruchan *shakes fist*) and ingredients.  Though not as produce-centric as Far East, they have much more in terms of sauces, frozen food, and even cooking untensils.\n\nDon't miss out on grabbing some cuttle fish chips, crushed pear juice, and some frozen man doo, among the many things you can find here, but nowhere else.","10205":"The bar tender Jessica is amazing, make sure you come to her section. This restaurant is absolutely amazing!! The music is great and the atmosphere is so inviting. Come check it out!!","10206":"Stopped in yesterday for dinner. Terrible food. Very bland and not cooked enough.","10207":"Although it is not my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley, Los Olivos is definitely my first choice for Mexican food in Old Town Scottsdale. The building itself has unique architecture (although it would be nice if they didn't need a sign that asks people not to climb on it) and according to the menu, a great deal of history. The location is also great, being in close proximity to Old Town Shopping and the Scottsdale Civic Center Mall. Further, the first time I went to Los Olivos, there was a mariachi band playing in the dining room.\n\nWhat I am forgetting in this review... oh yes... food!\n\nThe meal starts with two varieties of salsa and a basket of warm tortilla chips. I was pleased to find that the hot salsa was actually hot. I've tried the enchiladas and the burro (which is definitely not a burrito) and while both were tasty, I didn't find either to be anything special. One thing that did stand out to me was the Mexican style rice served with both dishes. I can't think of any better way to describe it than to say they got it \"right\". I could go on about the number of franchised Mexican and southwestern restaurants I've been to that screw up this basic side.\n\nThe prices and portions are reasonable, although with a group of five, all wanting to pay with plastic, it was frustrating that they weren't willing to split the check (and there was a sign posted stating this).","10208":"My mom originally introduced me to this place and my husband and I have been regulars to this place for several months now. We love this place! We love the seasonal, changing menus (the side of local mixed veggies changes every day) and the fresh ingredients, the desserts are great (love the turtle cake and apple cake), you get super refreshing cucumber water, plus I get a night off from cooking! There have been a few times I've had an inconsistent dish. There are also a few items on the menu I feel I make better in my own kitchen. The parking is also inconvenient. However we love this place for date night and can indulge in yummy vegan food in one of my favorite and personally nostalgic areas of the city. We have brought friends here and they love it, too. I've been loving the falafel salad lately; it's very filling, the falafel reminds me of crab cakes and the curried banana peppers are so delicious. Planning on going this week for my birthday dinner and I'm very excited (:\nLove this place, try it if you haven't!","10209":"Me and my wife go there every Saturday and we always have the same waitress. Food is great and the staff is very friendly. We usually get the just about the same thing every week so they know what we want. By the time we sit down w\/in about 10 mins our food is out. When your there ask for Ashley b\/c she takes care of us and is the best waitress they have over there and friendly as well.","10210":"Very nice scenery. It's nice even walking into the Wynn and seeing all the flowers in the lobby.  The food wasn't as good as the atmosphere however.  It was fine, but overpriced.  The service was a bit snooty.  You could definitely tell this was a more high end place.  To add to it, there were birds yelling and flying very close to the food!","10211":"Back in Minneapolis there used to be a food reviewer who would write glowingly about the food and then criticize the design of the wall sconces!! I have tried not to be that person. Other than messy bathrooms, I have never been put off by an occasional lapse in d\u00c3\u00a9cor. If the food and service are good, or even great, I am a fan. Sushi on the Roll, unfortunately, is a fairly new restaurant in a space that is overly large, sparsely filled with tables and no seeming \"flow\" to the lay out. The large amount of unused space is distracting, and either some partitions or floor to ceiling fabric treatments could help create a more intimate feeling.\nWe went at lunch, and my \"bowl\" of fried rice, shrimp, and a vegetable mix was very good. I sampled the shrimp roll & \"Chaz\" roll of a coworker and they were very good as well. The service is good, if not a bit confusing, as the signage says that you pick up your order \"here\", but they seem to hand deliver all orders to the table. Very friendly staff, and were great at helping us figure out the menu. I will be back to try again in the evening, and they have a \"happy hour\" option with sushi at $5.00 and 1\/2 priced drinks.","10212":"The food was just ok. Definitely not worth the average wait time of 1.5+ hours - unless you REALLY want their cheesecake. But if that's all you want get it to go.\n\nOur family decided to go today on a Saturday morning while doing some Christmas shopping. I was hoping the food would taste as good as it does in the United states. But alas, it did NOT.\n\nWe ordered the factory nachos: 5\/5 stars - it was LOADED with cheese and had a generous amount of guacamole & jalapenos. Only get it if you like it heavy!\n\nThe Dynamite tempura shrimp and Ahi tuna tartare were a disappointment. Did not taste good at all. Both 1\/5 stars and costs about $10 each. \n\nThe Philly cheese steak sandwich was 3\/5. I've had better, at a fraction of the price.  Do not get the fries as your side!! The fries were hard, cold and tasteless. \n\nThe Diane steak (3\/5 stars)was nothing to write home about. And at almost $28, you might as well go to a buffet. \n\n$100+ later....\nWe should have just gotten the cheesecake to go.","10213":"First time visiting this lvac. It's not bad, but it's not the best lvac out there. Plenty of machine, plenty of space, but very watered down lifters. The staff comes and tells you to quiet down if you're making too much noise, kinda like planet fitness. Didn't appreciate that too much. Also, I don't know if it's just me, but the lights are really dim. It makes you sleepy rather than ready for a workout. The facility is brand new so it's clean and the restrooms and lockers are nice. The staff at the front counter is also really nice. 3 star for telling me, I'm grunting too loud tho. Hopefully management could talk to staff about it and let them workout and focus on their workout.","10214":"Ice cream is awesome however the trainer here tonight is very dis concerned with the amount of customers waiting in line, very slow. Trainee is very kind and doing the best he can","10215":"This is not 5 Star Fine Dining so I am puzzled as to why people are complaining about kindness. \n\nGet yourself a HOT chicken roti with mango juice and take a couple of doubles to go.... THE BEST.","10216":"When I had my inspection done by Chris Hall he made me feel like he was buying the house his self. I really enjoyed his conversation and his vast knowledge that he shared with my wife and I. I would recommend Home Pride Inspections to everyone! I am in the Air Force and have lived in 4 different countries and lived in 9 different states, I have bought 3 houses and I have never had an inspector care so much about a house that was not even his. Thank you Chris! 5 Stars is not enough for this company.","10217":"I opened the door for 6 elder people, they all skipped me, when I was by myself on my lunch break at 11:45. The lady saw it, then wanted to be rude as can be and ask my order 1000 times after asking me what my problem was. You looked me in my face when they did it. You just wanted to add to my horrible experience with this place. I was waiting on togo the bus boy wouldn't stop staring at me, so i said where am I supposed to stand then. The tall darker guy said you can go have a seat. Im on my lunch break i replied, with him saying well you cant stand right here go have a seat maam. I will never be back here again, you gave me no ketchup utensils or any napkins. And the three onion rings I got were ice cold. Thanks for a really crappy lumch.","10218":"Awesome coffee !! Strong and delicious. New favorite place. Plus they have dairy free options","10219":"If you're in the outskirts of the strip or live nearby, I think this liquor store is probably one of the best places to go to. No, it's not really about the prices, but rather the owner is really friendly. Like, you can literally have an awesome conversation with him. Out of the two times I had a conversation with him, I walked out as if I was ready to party it up.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"Yep, just going to buy this bottle of Tequila for my friends visiting from California.\"\nOwner: \"Ah that's nice, bringing the party to Vegas huh?\"\n\"I guess, I didn't want to spend too much money on them so I just got Cuervo\"\nStarts laughing \"Not that good of friends huh? You know what? Here, take this small bottle of vodka with you too on the house.\"\n\nYes, both the times I come here, he gives me a little extra. Sure, the conversation makes me look like a total douche, but hey! I brought alcohol for my friends from California! No, don't think I redeemed myself.\n\nThe place is small and it's located right next to Don Tortaco and Taco Bell. So if you need a quick munch, you can head on over to those places right after. As for the selection? There's surprisingly a lot of alcohol packed into one place. They also sell cigarettes too. Beers are all in the fridge, need margarita mixes? They got you covered. Vodka? A whole row of them. They also have SoHo, a Lychee Liqueur that mixes well. Usually, I can only find that at Bevmo, so that was a plus if I ever decide I just want to be a little pansy and sip on fruity drinks.\n\nSo definitely come here for the service, the owner is very helpful and immediately asks if he can help right when you walk in. (Doesn't happen at a lot of liquor stores don't you think?)","10220":"I've always loved Fired Pie and still do. This location however is horrible. I was tempted to take a video of the guy who was putting sauce on the pizza for like 5 minutes (not even joking). Everyone working here was doing things so slowly not understand how long ppl were waiting in line. Will never come to this location again. I am writing this review at the restaurant after waiting for 40 minutes just to order and another 10 min to get the pizza. FYI there were only 7 people ahead of me when I came in.","10221":"A great local spot for burgers, fries, onion rings and other sandwiches. You can also pile on your own toppings yourself and they have a salad bar (if you're into that). My favorite is the teriyaki chicken sandwich that comes with a slice of pineapple for about $6. I get it on wheat with no cheese and load it up with onions and jalape\u00c3\u00b1os myself (no extra charge). A good local healthy option. \n\nThe gigantic burgers with multiple patties and cheese are also amazing in moderation. Everything is made to order. Staff are friendly. Cool place with good value.","10222":"They just added few items to the menu, tonight I tried the braised short ribs.... They were delicious!!  Great place to hang out. Outdoor patio is dog friendly. Good wine.","10223":"I come here for all of my Standard Poodle's grooming supplies! It's in a large wearhouse and parking is limited, but it's much cheaper than anywhere else and your dogs are welcome to go in with you. I would recommend coming here!","10224":"I highly recommend Omar's window tinting, I was browsing and calling around to a few different locations, but Omar was the one who provided the best quality work for the most reasonable pricing. I was able to call and get a the time that worked for me. I got my 2012 Chevy Sonic tinted. All 4 windows including the rear view window. Friendly service, shows you the chart of tint to pick from, and gets the job done quick with excellent quality and pricing.","10225":"I have been at this Starbucks location a few times and each time I go it gets worse. It isn't kept clean. You can't sit on the chairs by the windows for flys and the sides of the comfy chairs look like they haven't been wiped in a while let alone the floor.","10226":"I will never come to this store again, and I will never give either store my business again. I used to always go to the one up on Thunderbird and never really had a problem with how the animals were kept.. With the exception of the Guinea pigs and rabbits being in large troughs on the floor within reach of children that don't necessarily know how to respect animals & having animals that are being boarded within reach of the public as well. Besides that, I had no complaints and the staff were always wonderful there. About 3 weeks ago, I went to the Glendale branch and was appalled. Upon walking in, they have baby chicks in towers with feed trays surrounding the outside of them for them to stick their heads through to eat.. Only one of the chicks had escaped the pen and was teeter on the edge on one of the high feed platforms. Alarmed I ran over and asked my boyfriend to stand by it to make sure it didn't fall while I went and got a staff member. I grabbed a young man who seemed less than interested in what I just told him and was incredibly non-chalet. I then walked out to the back part outside where there were goats\/pigs\/peacocks ect. There were too many animals crammed into one pen and one worker was hosing (with a garden hose) down the pigs and goats to keep them cool (as AZ summers are 115). There's no reason to keep SO many animals in one pen, especially in this kind of heat. I was not at all fond of common pigeons being for sale for $2.00 either. Overall, after my experience at the Glendale location, I don't want Pratt's to have my business at all because animal welfare is clearly not a top priority there. Very disappointing.","10227":"AMAZING!!!!\nWe had the Vegetarian Chef Tasting. Every course was better than the last-fresh ingredients and perfect flavors. You cannot beat the naan-the garlic was my favorite\nIt is soooo much food that we had an entire meal for the next day, so it was DEFINITELY worth the price.\nThe service was also great, and all staff members were extremely helpful and friendly.","10228":"It was okay.Because I was super hungry.But looks n sounds like they just used microwave for warm up.also I don't like the paper plate...\nTable was sticky.\nGood point was syrup was in warmer place.\nI think price is little bit pricy for this quality...\nAnd that's all.","10229":"This was a huge mistake coming to this place. Horrible service. Can't tell you how the food was, didn't wait around to find out. Definitely never going back.","10230":"I began using the East Parking area when I would travel a lot for work. Now that I don't travel for work, I do travel a bit for pleasure. I always opt for the parking garage (B). My car is in a covered area, close to the Sky Train and to the 202. I am in charge of getting my car and getting home. I don't have to wait for a bus to pick me up and take me somewhere of site. I always advise people to use Sky Harbor Parking.","10231":"Horrible language barrier here. Ordered P4 and it came with Tripe (ewwwwww!!) called the server over and he said the English menu doesn't specify it but supposedly the Viet version does????? How the hell does that make sense?!? He couldn't even explain to me because his English was terrible. I have a shrimp allergy and from that point didn't want to eat any of the other dishes we ordered because how the hell do i know if there's shrimp\nIn it or not because that menu is unreliable from that point. Egg rolls are whackkkkkk! Seems like super generic frozen brand...Don't eat here. Only came here since they opened early. Searching Yelp now for another pho house because I'm starving!!!","10232":"We love Paul! My wife lucy has been going to Paul for her hair care for five years now. We were very lucky to find him as we moved to Las Vegas in 2012. She is in the entertainment business and Paul makes her look as beautiful as she can be. Very Important! The extensions that he gets are the finest quality. ( last batch were 24 inch blond )The work that he does is top notch and we are very pleased! It looks like My wifes own hair as I stand 12 inches away and look at it. His coloring is spot on perfect. Paul is a total professional and we recomment him to any and all! And yes we still drive to vegas from Southern California now for him to do her hair. Thanks Paul. Your the best!","10233":"So, Mom and Dad live in Sun City and this restaurant is something like 6 blocks from their house, making it a very convenient place to get some Thai food. I've always had a great meal here in the past, but on this visit, I don't know, something was off.\n\nI ordered the Kung Phad Noh Mai: Shrimp stir-fried with bamboo shoots, baby corns, carrots and mushrooms in oyster sauce. When it came, there were onions and green peppers mixed in, so I asked the waitress if this was, in fact, what I ordered, because I specifically chose something that didn't have onions in it. I don't have an allergy to onions, I just really detest them. If I can get something without them, so I'm not paying for something that I won't eat, I will. I think that makes perfect sense! Her response was that they just didn't put those ingredients on the menu! Ok, ok, I can pick them out (which is exactly what I did), but if they weren't on the menu, then they shouldn't be in the dish, IMO. What if I had a food allergy? \n\nI will go back, but guaranteed, I will be stating NO ONIONS IN MY DISH.\nFor anyone else, I guess you had better ask and maybe ask again if a specific ingredient is in a dish. For me it was just a food preference, but for someone else, it could be life or death!\n\n\n4\/2017","10234":"Walking in this place, I was in love with their decor from the neon signs to the pineapple wall. It is a bit more upscale than I expected. I sat outside at the bar. The menu is innovative with brussel sprouts nachos, which had two kinds of cheeses. The nachos had tortilla chips as well but I went back and forth between those and the brussel sprouts for good measure (and health)! They also had a list of amazing tacos, which you can get with handmade flour or corn tortillas. \n\nI liked this place, but honestly, it's the only place (restaurant, bar, brewery) I went to on my weeklong trip to Arizona where I didn't talk to a single person. The people who come here reminded me of the Orange County (California) bunch at home.","10235":"The best NY pizza in the valley!! Being from Brooklyn myself I can testify that this is real not that NYPD pizza processed stuff. Mike and Tony are from the Bronx and like I said this is as close you can get to New York. Trust me!! You will not regret it!!!","10236":"I spent 15 minutes in the store. Young, lazy salesgirl did not acknowledge my presence nor did she offer to help me. Most likely I would have purchased several items had there been adequate customer service. There are many unique stores on Ellsworth as well as S Highland with excellent salespeople. Skip this one.","10237":"These guys were SO helpful! Most movers overcharge you just to move a piece of furniture- they were a great price and incredibly helpful! They even did little extras for me! I would recommend these boys to anyone who needs just a few heavy pieces moved or an entire house!! Call them today!!","10238":"Who knew that the people working here were paid to make fun of those who didn't speak french? \nI certainly didn't when I stopped in to order some food on a regular Friday night. \n\nTo management: I hope you seriously take a look at who you hire in the future.  Even though I don't speak french, my friend certainly did, and didn't appreciate how your staff rudely made fun of me for not speaking it. They're paid to do their job, take orders, and make food, not give their opinions on their customers. \n\nTo future customers: spend your money elsewhere unless you want to be rudely berated. An absolutely disgusting example of montreal customer service. \n\nSo glad I didn't end up spending money here after they insulted me. I will never spend money at another amir restaurant ever again.","10239":"Eh. Idk why people come here so often, there are other places to get real bagels people! Im pretty sure everything here is frozen, if not it sure tastes like it is. This place doesn't need our money. Try going to a local business with authentic bagels instead of this rich low-quality chain that makes the same bagel here as it does in its NYC locations. I doubt any New Yorkers would waste their money on these wannabe bagels. Kind of lowers the standards for the American bagel, but if you like cheap quality food like McDonald's then this place is for you","10240":"I went to Vegas for the weekend for my wedding and let me tell you that this hotel is amazing! First we go in to check in at the Palazzo and the front desk let me know about a FREE upgrade to a better suite at the Venetian. We took it and it was gorgeous! Beautiful bathroom, lounge area and bed. Very clean and very spacious. Had a nice view of the pools and liked the fact that you can open the blinds by a switch near the bed! Really cool. Also got a late checkout from the front desk. I absolutely loved my stay and I will be staying here my next visits to Vegas!","10241":"They do have the best selection of tennis anything in the valley. Prices are standard - but the selection is so extensive it makes the drive worthwhile. Customer service is always mediocre - dh prefers to shop at tennis warehouse because they have exceptional customer service. I like to keep my dollars local, but to be frank, they make it a hassle. If their service matched their selection they would be amazing!","10242":"Stopped in for some quick dim sum.  The dumplings were very good! Would love to try dinner!","10243":"I've never been to the gym, but still rating this based on the experience I had trying to even get information from them!  After my frustrations, I can't foresee going there to work out.\n\nI've tried calling them twice, to find out about personal training costs.  Don't get me wrong, both times they were nice, but I have still not received any information from them, even after giving them my e-mail address twice.  I called and spoke with a gentleman a couple of weeks ago, and he kept asking me questions, but didn't seem to register my answers.  I guess he was reading from a script.\n\nI don't like it when you ask someone what they charge for a service (which I did) and their response is, \"Well, what can you afford?\" or \"Well what is your budget?\" Instead of this translating to me that they're willing to negotiate a price, I get a used-car salesman feel of, \"We're willing to for you to pay much lower, but we won't tell you that. We'll find out what your max is, so we can push you as close to that dollar amount as possible.\" I don't have a budget yet.  I'm sorry... how about you give me some prices, and I'll figure out if I can afford it...\n\nThe guy also asked when it was convenient for me to work out.  I work during \"normal business hours,\" in fact later, so it would be late at night after my kids go to sleep, when someone else is at the house to be w\/them, and I'm not an early riser\/morning person, which I specifically told him.  His response was, \"Well, if you can be there at five a.m. a personal trainer can be there for you.\"  Why ask me what my schedule is and when it would be convenient for me to work out, if you're going to tell me who is available when I'm not?  I also had my weekend fully booked for my kids' activities, which I also told him multiple times, indicating I wasn't able to come in to talk to a manager, and that I would prefer they just e-mail me the information.  Then, w\/out listening, he said, \"Why don't you come in on Saturday, or Sunday, 9-2, when my manager is here, or come on Monday 8-5 when my manager is here?\"  Um.... it's like I was talking to a wall b\/c I had JUST said I wasn't available during those times!\n\nI'm not a \"lookie-loo\", but I'm not pulling teeth to get info. from them anymore and now have zero desire to go in and use their facility.  If they're open 24\/7, they should truly be available 24\/7.","10244":"Purchased a Groupon and was assigned to Amy for a 90 minute therapeutic massage I believe it is Amy M. She didn't excellent job and I would highly recommend. I had the best neck massage and mild traction. My neck felt wonderful all day.  The spa is extremely clean and feels like going to the four seasons. Everything is nice and quiet peaceful tranquil. I do have to give a shout out to Amy for being so professional and stating that this was my time to relax and that she was going to be quiet now. It is so difficult when you go to massage places that the massage therapist is so chatty that you can't relax. I had a great massage. \n My massage was 9 AM and I actually had just woke up went for massage felt like it fall back asleep again and then went home and took a nap for an hour and a half. I have not been sleeping well lately so this was such a treat to feel so relaxed that I was able to take a nap. Thank you","10245":"Squarz is a hidden gem. The owner\/baker is so friendly and takes the time to describe the menu. I've had the chocolate croissant, Kouign Amann, and mac & cheese. Everything I've had here has been top knotch. The Kouign Amann is a stand out (buttery, flaky, and not overwhelming sweet).\n\nI can't wait to come back to try the entire menu. Also, if you buy 5 pastries, you get the 6th for free. More incentive to be a glutton!","10246":"SIMPLY the BEST\nComing to Desert Ridge in Jan. 09!!!!!!!!!\nWest side of Tatum -North of 101 -in corporate officepark","10247":"Service Advisor Dustin was very helpful and courteous helping get our first oil change for our 2014 Honda Civic as we were getting ready to drive to Colorado soon as this car had 5,700 miles on it as I could have gone the next day to Honda West where I purchased the car but wanted to get the oil change done already before my wife and I go on our trip to Denver. I think that we might have overpaid for the oil change with Pep Boys cause I got an email from Honda West for an oil change for $29.95 which I believe I was overcharged quite a bit even though I got $15.00 off using my Pep Boys Rewards card. I would very much like to have some money coming back to me. Thanks for your time","10248":"I called in a water leak which was coming out of the water meter box, clear full of water, and they said it would take 2 weeks to come out.   After two weeks with no calls and still a water leak I called them and they said they fixed 4 days ago.   I told them that water was still coming out of the top of the water box and they said \"well, we will schedule it again but can't do anything today.   So who knows.  I feel bad for their customer reps because they must just get beat every day.   They charge you $400 a month for water and have crap service, and bitch they need another 35% increase to survive!","10249":"Great place, great for all ages and handicapped accessible, lots to do, food and drinks, they also have alcohol drinks for over 21! Putt putt golf, bowling, bounce house area, lots of games, virtual reality, go carts, so much more","10250":"Leigh is an amazing injector who takes the time to provide her clients with the best correction using less product than others with less experience.  Results are natural. She is educated in many types of filler so can choose the right one for each client and concern.  Her space is beautifully decorated, clean and professional. The Babyface line of products is excellent.  She also offers dermaplaning, which makes your skin soft and fuzz free.  I highly recommend Leigh and have sent many friends to her.","10251":"This farmers market is a lot bigger than the one on Thursdays at Gardens Park. There are all types of vendors from vegetables and fruits to jewelry. There was a tent that sold kid things like a batman\/superman interchangeable cape which my daughter wanted and of course I got for her. She looked so cute and had it on the whole time we were there. They also have a couple of food trucks and food tents so it would be a great idea to take the kiddos down there since the park is right next to the farmers market. Most families bought their groceries and let their kids run around. I bought some kettle corn (YES, KETTLE CORN), ate and watched my daughter burn off all the pent up energy she saved from being stuck at home with her papa. She'd play, come and eat then play some more. The vendors were for the most part friendly. There is a few who were very insistent like the honey guy. Definitely check this out on Wednesday night!","10252":"Happy hour quality was not good for me. I had yellowtail and it did not seem fresh. I ordered a vodka martini since they have a full bar but no one knew how to make it so I was told not available. The only drinks available were sweet specialty drinks they have on the menu. My opinion and experience.","10253":"Decided to try out this place with the family. We were super impressed, and we'll definitely be coming back!  The menu offers a terrific selection of items. Of the several things we tried, everything was exceptional. The onion rings i had were light and crispy, and accompanied by a really tasty cheese and beer dip. I also thoroughly enjoyed the crusted chorizo and mozzarella appetizer my dad ordered. One of the best dishes i've had in a while! \n\nThe selection of drinks is very nice as well. The Irv offers up a  wide range of local beers, wines, and spirits. If you can't find one that interests you, you're doing something wrong!\n\nAside from the food, the atmosphere is really inviting and laid back. It's the perfect place to go grab a beer to watch the game at. The staff are all very friendly, and we didn't have any problems when it came to ordering food, waiting too long for something, etc. Chef is also very involved, and came up frequently to chat and say high to guests which was really nice.\n\nOverall, it's a great joint, and once this awful winter ends, i bet it will be even better when their patio opens! Check it out!!!","10254":"If you have no need to stay on THE STRIP, this close to the airport and car rental return hotel is a very good choice. We paid $109 a night for a studio that has a full kitchen and free parking.  Free airport transportation was available. There were a dining table and a office table in the large room.  Free breakfast daily and weekday light dinner were included in the price.  Gym and laundry facility were on site.  There was even a public bus stop in front of the hotel to get you around town. All the employees were extremely friendly and helpful.  No hesitation in staying here again.","10255":"Not the best stay ever. Shower took 10 min to heat up. Internet was moving at a snails pace and then stopped working completely. I'm writing this review on my phone now...Also room service is EXPENSIVE. I'm talking 12.5 for a wedge salad. I've had a long trip and didn't want to go out but those prices are crazy.\n\nWould like to add that the front desk is very accommodating and very nice.","10256":"PRO\n-Nice towels (they actually absorb water!)\n-location in Ohio City\n-few minutes to subway\n-free parking\n-decent prices!\n\nNEG\n-shower was not cleaned when we checked in at 8 pm; soap grime and hair in shower (individual room, not shared bathroom)\n-pillow case reeked of the past nights cologne, this guy overdid it!!!\n-one of the hottest summers (2016) and room was at different times warm\/hot (especially for sleeping), bought a cheap fan at walmart (which helped but was inconvenient)\n-better suited for younger (30 and under), can be loud (rent spaces for parties, etc).\n-bed was hard\/not comfortable\n-if you are spending the extra for your own bathroom\/singular room throw a TV in the room, especially help with all the hall noise\n-being asked to join a yoga class on the small rooftop for $10, we just wanna check out the view.\n\nrooftop is a nice touch, not as breathtaking as others claimed.  Personally we had no interest in shared kitchen, if you are looking too cook, etc; a big plus!","10257":"A bit disappointed in this weekend's visit. I've eaten at NNY for quite a few years, and after an afternoon of furniture shopping, and surrounded by the bit \"Mall\" restaurants, I was pleased to see NNY, so my wife and I went in. We sat ourselves and a waitress came by a few minutes later to see if we had been helped. \n\nShe didn't know what beer they had on draft, odd, since half of what you sell is probably beer, and when my wife asked a question about a mixed drink she wasn't sure. I ordered the House Calzone, sausage, pepperoni, ricotta, mozzarella, and marinara sauce. My wife ordered the apple walnut salad with chicken on top and the dressing on the side.\n\nThe waitress came by to see if we wanted another drink. The blue drink my wife ordered was too sweet for her to drink another, so the waitress suggested the green drink on the opposite page. (East and West Coast, but I can't recall which was which.) The green one has sweet and sour mix in it, which gives my wife indigestion when it's the main component of something like a margarita, so she asked the waitress how much sweet and sour was in there. She didn't know, and headed off to the bar to find out.\n\nThe manager showed up with the food shortly after that and we asked her. She said they could leave the sweet and sour out, so my wife said that would be fine. She asked if there was any dressing, as it was supposed to be on the side. The kitchen had tossed it in with the salad. It was a very light vinaigrette, so she was okay with it. The manager left to put in the drink order and my wife noticed that her salad was missing chicken. She's watching me eat my calzone, attempting to get the attention of the waitress. She finally came over and threw the cooks under the bus: \"I put the order in right, they messed it up.\" She went to get the chicken. And my wife watched me eat.\n\nFor a pizza and wings place, the calzone was marginal. It didn't seem to have very much in it. I didn't detect any ricotta cheese, but was surprised by a lot of diced green peppers, which are supposed to go in the veggie calzone. Not my favorite, but I ate them. While my wife watched. Eventually, her green drink came, as did a plate of sliced chicken breasts, which appeared to be straight from the microwave. Although they appeared to have grill marks, it didn't taste like they had been anywhere near a grill. My wife said it tasted like boiled chicken, unseasoned, and totally unpleasant on the salad. We go to Oregano's a lot, and their chicken marinade complements the flavor of the salad. This seemed like an afterthought.\n\nThen manager was very gracious about the whole thing. She took my wife's salad off the bill, as well as one of my beers.\n\nI might go back if we're in that area in a few months, just to see if it's improved. If so, I'll probably stick to the wings.","10258":"tried the tiramisu, pretty good\nthe interior doesnt really match the cute vibe though","10259":"This is such a good concept. Pick you carb, veggie, meat, and sauce. I had the shrimp and steak and it was delicious! Good live music. Something to enjoy on the patio while the weather is still nice. I'll definitely be back!","10260":"Not exactly my kind of place to hang, but it is good for what it is. Festive barn kind of atmosphere, great place for kids.  The pulled meats are really good and the hand cut fries are divine. There is a corner in the restaurant that houses all the sauces. My favorite is the sauce with the ginger. So tangy and so tasty. I ate the salad with pulled turkey and cranberries. The dressing was an apple cider vinegarette, but I covered everything up with that ginger sauce!  Yum in the tum.  Very casual spot, just a bit too loud and frenetic for me.  I will actually probably return to the barn, mostly for that ginger stuff.","10261":"Great place when great service is done, however they have been closing early on weekends for whatever reason and they have no excuse to do so! I work for a place that has the employee network discount and that's another reason why my husband and I go there so much! The other day my sister in law and I went there and there were cones in the way so no one goes through! This has happened multiple times and I hope this never happens again!","10262":"My wife was so distraught after our meal @ Rotanas and wanted to do her nails! As a husband I don't usually pay attention to the details of nails but she was so pleased and the staff were great friendly and fast! Her nails look stunning!! To bad you guys have such a horrible restaurant next door because my wife will be back for her nails again! Great work!","10263":"We were hesitant to try this place on Labor Day, but the food was great and delivered timely. The server (Nick) was excellent and able to make suggestions for the food and beer menu. Only giving 3 stars for a 45 minute wait when there were plenty of open tables. They really need to make adjustments in the kitchen to fix this problem.","10264":"Lived up to the hype that my friends stated!  Picked up 99 cents power strips and wireless earphones.  Didn't want to look to good since I had little room in the luggage.  You will definitely find useful items at a great price!  Unfortunately, none of the staff acknowledged or welcomed us.","10265":"Joe did a great job on my carpets and my sofa for a great price and a smile The owner, Rick, not only got me a quote in record time through Yelp, but also responded to a question of mine that I emailed with a phone call in under a minute. I couldn't ask for anything more from a carpet cleaning service.","10266":"This is our favorite local Mexican restaurant.  We enjoy the chips and salsa + cole slaw.  We have all found our favorite dishes here.  Pretty standard Mexican restaurant offerings.  Prices are good.","10267":"Good service... Good ambiance and the food was good... Went for dinner buffet... Had almost all of the choices in the menu and everything was really good from the Thai to the sushi options everything tasted good... A must try","10268":"TLDR: Great spot for a slice of late night pizza on De la Montagne just under St. Catherine. \n\nPizza Chez Danny makes tasty pizza that will squash your late night craving. The crust is thin and crisp on the bottom, but soft on top. The addition of sesame seeds on the top adds a delicious nuttiness to every bite of the sweet crust. The mixed cheese of the simple cheese pizza melts into yummy goodness and sits on a light dose of tomato sauce. With tax, the slice came out to around $3, and it was delicious. I definitely recommend this place for your Americanized pizza itch.","10269":"I gotta say ...the food...eh. its ok. but this place is so cute . All you can drink for twenty dollars with your food...the wine is probably carlo rossi or whatever that stuff id that comes in a box, but i wouldnt go for the food. Id go to just look at the pics on the wall and listen to the cute older gentleman serenade me. Its really nice to get away from the main part of the strip crowded with people and full of snobs.. this place has a \"family \" vibe and I think everyone should visit it at least once. because we all know the \"old \" vegas landmarks can only hold on for so long before they get plowed over for a new starbucks or mac store can be built in its place...","10270":"Amazing food and service! We ordered a causa de tuna, tiraditos, a chaufa, and a couple of desserts! We loved everything especially the tiraditos! The sauce was amazing. The causa de tuna was a definite favorite too. The chaufa was delicious and had plenty of shrimp and chicken in it. We liked the desserts as well but I would recommend their ice cream over the flan for sure.","10271":"AMAZING savory pies!!!  The green chili gringo hand pie is RIDICULOUS.  Perfect flakey crust, just the right amount of filling of Pork Green Chili, Eggs, Potatoes and Cheddar- great on the go breakfast!  I also tried the 5\" Pork Green Chili POT PIE, which of course was wonderful.  We need one more pizza and\/or desert shop across the street and we can officially call this stretch of Coronado bordering 7th street: THE PIE DISTRICT.","10272":"Waiter disappeared for the whole dining experience before we even got our food. Was told happy hour appetizers were half off then they tried to charge full price.Food tasted ok but an hour after we got back into our room we were sick as dogs. Had to stay in our hotel room instead of going out that night. The next day we overheard a group of four say they were all throwing up and I asked why, surprise surprise they all got sick after eating there too. Update got home to realize they double charged us for our meal lol it just gets better and better.","10273":"I order from these guys about twice a month....always friendly on the  phone and the food is usually quite good. They're close to my house so I always pick up. I recommend for those who don't like pizza chains (I don't).","10274":"A very cool experience. Six course meal - all vegetarian with plant based proteins. The dining room was pitch black. I would recommend this for anyone wanting to try something different.","10275":"We decided on this location because they were one of the only locations that had space without a wait during the lunch rush.\n\nToby Keith has a great atmosphere and the waitress wear assless chaps. That took me completely by surprise. Our waitress quickly took our order and was prompt on delivery.\n\nShe recommended the steaks, chicken fried steak, and the the fajitas. \n\nI ordered the combo fajitas which was $25. Unfortunately the food is extremely lacking. Every meal ordered by our party of 9 was disappointing. My meats were bland and flavor less. One of my groups mentioned that my steaks were beef jerky. The food quality wouldn't have been so bad if the prices weren't so unbelievably high for the food. I wouldn't return to this location. They are opening a newer location on my home town so I'll try that once to see if it's similar.","10276":"By no means is this place spectacular, but Kristine F., who complained about the use of plastic plates\/utensils and the lack of table service, is a giant imbecile. Reading reviews like her's annoys me; she should be completely disregarded. It's a Chinese take-out\/fast-food place!\n\nI have been here twice now and have ordered Sesame Chicken, String Beans, Fried Rice, Fried Dumplings, and Wonton Soup. Keeping in mind that this is a Chinese take-out place, I still think they could do a better job with the food. For example, the Sesame Chicken did not have any crisp to it, but was just chicken with soggy batter; the wonton soup's broth was flavorless. I must say however, that this is one of the better take-out places in the North Scottsdale area. So if you are craving for cheap Chinese food, this may be it!","10277":"First time in the meat department, butcher is very nice and helpful. Was happy to cut me a fresh filet to my size request. Even offered a free chicken sausage link after he learned my son doesn't like spicy food. Prices are reasonable. Good selection overall.","10278":"This place is the ultimate family setting for Brazilian Jiujitsu.  The instructors are a family unit with family values and instructs with a passion you don't normally see these days within the business.  I have attended other schools, but Gracie\/Medavia Jiujitsu is a humble and pleasant school.","10279":"Honestly, this is a decent restaurant chain but very overrated. The food is good, but certainly not exceptional enough to deserve the rather high price tag. Everything at all Cora's restaurants is quite expensive - four dollars for a glass of orange juice!! - and frankly I just don't think it's worth it.","10280":"My server was Caitlyn.  She was amazing and very accommodating to me and my service dog.  Very polite and easy going.  Always checked to see if I needed anything.  The wings are cooked to order.  And I drive over 45  minutes just to dine at this NNY.","10281":"Easily a 5-Star experience. The menu items have an obvious thoughtfulness behind them. Adding The Coronado to my very short, but ever increasing, list of Phoenix gems. Don't miss out ;)","10282":"Wanted to try somewhere new for breakfast. After reading reviews we decided to give it a go. Walking in you can smell all the different kinds of food. It smelt wonderful. It was seat yourself, which was easy. It was a little crowed and loud like a cafeteria. We waited for like 10 minutes for someone to finally acknowledge us to take our drink order and since we had time to look over the menu we where able to order our food. It seemed like it took awhile for us to get our food. \n\nWe ordered the French toast with a side of sausage links. Two eggs with bacon\/sliced tomato with everything bagel. The people you sat down long after us order two sandwiches and they got their food quicker than us. The food was great. Eggs were perfect and not just put together real fast. French toast had four huge pieces. I order the everything bagel, it would have been good if they didn't burn the top. The food was great. \n\nThe services was just horrible. And not even worth it. When we finished we waited for our server to come with the check and we waited around 15 minutes for her to come. We never got any refills or even check on to make sure things were good. It was hard to even get someone's attention. Three stars for service. Otherwise would have given five. Might go back, but order carry out instead.","10283":"The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2 stars is because the ribs without the sauce are really really good and so was the corn.  He advised us that the brisket would be really good but I found it dry and unappealing.  I like my brisket moist and fatty not lean and dry.  Also they say they close at 9 but the waitress started sweeping and cleaning around us while we were eating and saying they were closing in 15 mins. If your going to close at 830 say you close at 830 don't advertise that you close at 9","10284":"Everytime my family visits we go here for some great service and been better food. The Spivey fried chicken is the best! But really it is all good food.","10285":"a lot of people like the rio buffett. I tried it and didn't like it AT ALL. \n\nThe seafood weren't fresh! that's why.  I expect it to be good quality for the price!","10286":"Family operated and excellent service, Il Bosco serves up some excellent pies! Imports a ton of items from Italy. We love this place!","10287":"What can I say- Awesome! Loved the skillet corn bread!  First time having the crab cakes...will definitely have again!  Highly recommend the pulled pork and beer can chicken - moist, great flavor and loved the variety of homemade bbq sauces on the table - need to sell at the restaurant.","10288":"The new location (3813 Euclid) is now open and it's amazing!! There are definitely some kinks in the system but it's opening day and to be expected. The new exhibits are amazing and so are the employees all over the place!","10289":"Ordered delivery and it never arrived after waiting an hour and a half. Tried to call the store to check the status of my order and they didn't pick up the phone.","10290":"I ordered a Long Fisherman sweater and had to return it..My credit card was charged a higher amount. They added on a shipping charge which I was supposed to be free shipping.  Had to call and get it straightened out. \n Please make sure and check you credit card to make sure you are not being overcharged!","10291":"We love coming here for Brunch. They have incredible tasty gluten free bread for their bruschetta. Their toppings are delicious all of them. My husband loves their French Toast and gets it every time. Great location in Kierland. The staff is great. They mixed up my order and there was a small wait so they took off the whole order. Cannot beat that!! We are regulars now","10292":"LOVE SALON G\nGreat products\nGreat atmosphere \nGreat talent\n\"G\" Must stand for GORGEOUS because that's how I feel when I leave. My daughter & I have come here for years...NATALIE SHAKE is my Color\/Cut Wizard. Love her","10293":"Melinda Murphy was literally sent into my life at precisely the right time to sell my condo.  It was extremely emotional and high risk for me, and I was so confused I could not make good decisions, if any. \n\nShe took great time and effort to explain things in a way I could understand, possibly helped by her long time experience as an AA Big Book sponsor.  \n\nShe calmed me down and explained everything in detail, what needed to be done, how, when, and provided a specialty photographer who took flattering pictures.\n\nIt sold in 2 1\/2 weeks !!!  She networked the listing everywhere and then got the buyer to drop all but 2 issues easily with a simple $500 toward repairs.  It closed 8\/11\/116 and I am sure it would still be sitting dead on the Phx market at much less if I had a different realtor.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend Melinda as your realtor because of my experience as a seller who was totally paralyzed with fear over what could happen in the wrong hands.  \nJorge","10294":"Well, the I'd comment on the food but, it's been almost an hour and we haven't gotten any food yet. The music is on 10. It wouldn't be so bad if they had a speaker when they call put names. But, they don't. So, everyone is looking at each other  saying what did they say??  I'm not sure I'll ever come back here again.","10295":"Ross is one of those discount stores that hit or miss. Sometimes you find great deals and sometimes the place is just trashed.  I roll the dice every time I hit a Ross.  But today, here to get some shirts for my son, the only person actually friendly with the staff was the security guard who \"welcomed\" us into the store.  Murielle, the checker, may have been having a bad day but she was not friendly at all.  Yelling very aggressively \"next in line\" not in a high volume so customers can hear but more aggressive like irritated she had to check out the line of people waiting.  Once there she didn't address us and removed the hangers from the clothes by tossing them onto the counter, even hitting my hand as I was leaving on the counter.  Then asking cash or card, irritably and then screamed next in line after I began paying.  As I was paying she finished bagging up the clothes and tossed them at me. Covering my hand again as I was putting my numbers into the debit machine.   I'll try to avoid this store in the future, no reason for any employee of any kind of store to treat customers so aggressively and irritably.  Thanks for the couple of discounted shirts Ross I'll spend the extra doe and go somewhere else where I get treated like a human.","10296":"amazingggg took forever to get here. got 2 1\/3 pound and a 1\/2 pound. $20.50 oy soo expensive. but hey thats poke anywhere. if u get the poke with shoyu sauce. get it on the side. i got in on it and it was drenched and was too much. the ahi with spicy mayo was the best. ill come back but ya poke is expensive.","10297":"Great breakfast spot! Love that they advertise their use of cooking with cage free eggs and real butter and evoo. Makes the quality of food that much better! Came on a Saturday morning around 10 and with a party of 6 I expected there to be a decent wait but within minutes we were seated! Guy working at the front was awesome, very friendly and efficient! Our waitress was just okay but the food was great!! Hubby got the waffles and they were honestly phenomenal. And as for the bacon, I cannot wait to go back and get some more! Bacon was out of this world. Great food at decent prices, I'll definitely be back!","10298":"We were referred here from a friend when we moved into the area, my husband (who is terrified of the dentist) needed a root canal and a cleaning. Both procedures (and the crown that followed) were quick and easy- the team was very accommodating of my hubby's phobia. In fact, on his third visit he didn't even need me to go with! Very Impressive Heatherwood- keep up the good work!!","10299":"One of the few good korean restaurant in this area. They cut back on some things from the last time I came. But the food was good. I'll be back.","10300":"I visited The Barber of Choix recently and was very impressed. I got a shave and a haircut. I had never had a straight razor shave and the experience is great. It's very much like the old-style shave you see in movies with the relaxing chair, the hot towel, the mug shave-cream, the straight razor and then the after shave. The whole experience was very relaxing and fun. I would definitely recommend it.","10301":"Maria, the manager, has the freshest dough of any Papa Murphy's in the valley. I always stop here if I am in Goodyear!  Have been to them all and this is th best.  The store is always clean, they have the freshest ingredients and the dough always rises and tastes like it is made fresh daily.","10302":"Adorable bakery in our beautiful old Montreal. The entrance is nicely decorated with summer vibe. Plants, and little light bulbs illuminating lightly the porch. There is a bench on the side of the door; and the writing\"J'aime beurre\" on it. It was simply adorable. Inside, the counter with all the sweet goodies in a glass display. On the wall, few goodies placed on the shelves like cookies in jar, tote bag and many more things. Even on the stairs, the writing\"J'aime beurre\" are on it. \n\nThe service is very amiable. We ordered our foods and drinks; and our server told her that she will bring our drinks to us. We went to second floor, where the sitting are. It was nice and cozy. \n\nI had macaroons (pistachio, raspberry and Mango). Our macaroons aren't regular size than usual ; they are actually petite. For my drink, my choice was matcha latte. Everything tasted so good. \n\nThe prices were a bit high, compared to any other bakeries. \n\nOverall, cute place and delicious food.","10303":"Everything here is hand made and delicious. You can even see them making the tortillas in back, so fresh! Everything I have tried here is delicious and Carolina's in now my go to Mexican food place in the area. \n\nIt is often busy and can take some time to order and get your food, but it is so busy because it is so delicious!","10304":"YUMM!!!!!  love the burgers!   I really like that you can customize and the food is worth the price.","10305":"I used to think that this place only sold winter type clothes but how ignorant of me! Now a days, I find any excuse to shop here. \n\nI recently bought a snowboarding jacket, snow pants, gloves andddddd a hydroflask lid, all for an affordable price! Good quality too! Very warm, many layers. \n\nSomething I obsess about and have one in almost every color are the thinner jackets. Perfect for a semi cold weather, the rain or to wear as a top layer.  They usually have a discount on almost all their items so even more of an excuse to binge shop. \n\nThey even have lunch bags, scarves, luggages, hydroflask, bandanas, hats, etc. Basically outdoor adventure type gear. \n\nStaff at this location are all behind the counter and none of the floor. Once in a while I see some step out to help consumers but they should do it more often especially when there's so many foreign people shopping there.\n\nTIP: If you're looking for something specific, call first and be prepared to wait a long time on the phone. There isn't an easy way for them to look something up. I guess it depends on how much you want it!","10306":"My kids love this place! Novelty that they freeze the ice cream fresh right before your eyes. They love that they can pick their own flavor of ice cream and of course all the choices of toppings, of which they say they have 50. Staff is super friendly, place is clean and seating indoors and out. The price is slightly higher than I like to pay ($6.50 for a medium with 2 toppings, lucky had $1 off Yelp coupon) for a treat but once in a while it's OK to splurge.","10307":"Es una buena opci\u00c3\u00b3n cuando el XS no est\u00c3\u00a1 abierto y la party debe seguir.","10308":"Lovely place. I had a good cappucino and tried their ramen soup. It was good but I didn't find it amazing... The homemade donuts are great though. Overall it is a great little cafe,  but it does have this name for a reason ! SO SMALL. The atmosphere is nice but i was barely sitting on somebody else's knees !!","10309":"should have give them zero star \nwhat a shittty pizza we have ever eat\nnever order from these guys.\ndough was so rough and barely have enough cheese on pizza\nwe even paid $20 tip to driver but actually pizza tastes sucks and not worth ordering it.\nu guyz messed it up our dinner....","10310":"Came in here for breakfast. Food was meh. Hash brown and sausages seemed commercial. Eggs were eggs, a bit bland. \n\nBut this review is about cleanliness of the restaurant. when I seated my napkin was a bit crumbled and there where some unused packets of syrup. (packets, really?)\n\nIt was obvious they hadn't cleaned the table completely, yet the hostess just took the napkin, and I had to call her attention to the packets.\n\nBasically everything was ok (not good). When I was done I decided to wait a few seconds and watch them clean the table to my left. They just picked up the dishes and napkins and wiped any area that was not covered or hard to reach. Since there were to big placemats they were not cleaned or anything and all the crumbs were left on them. Also the area that the check was on was never wiped, nor the other diagonal side because that would have meant walking around the table to clean the other side.\n\nSo it get's 1 star for less than minimum cleanliness required.","10311":"I love beer. To hold an event just for that is already going to get a great rating.\n\nThere are usually 2 large beer festivals that go on in a year. One of them is the Toronto Beer Festival in July and then this one The Roundhouse Winter Craft Beer Festival. This one is much smaller then the one in Aug but still holds about 2 dozen brewers compared to the 150 at the Aug event. \n\nThe tickets in advance are $20 or $25 at the door (limited quantity) and you get a nifty mug to have your beer poured into. If you are going for the door tickets but expect to be there for 8am to line up for them as they will only have around 100 available. I arrived for 10am thinking I can get in but was shut down 5 guys from the gate. They advised to come back around 2pm to maybe let more in but was no guarantees. So we left, went to Real Sports bar for some grub then came back to again be shut down 5 guys from the gate (what were the odds). Luckily we were able to do some magic and was able to get in. Lesson learned, get tickets in advanced. If you do have advanced tickets then prepare to wait a while to get in as they pace the number of people entering to make the event smoother to handle. As well they have to check ID, give you bracelets and do a security check on you.\n\nOnce you do get in, you'll be greeted with a free toque and with someone selling tokens for the drinks. They are $1 each but sell in packs of 10 or 20. Most of the brewers are Ontario brewers unlike the Aug event has brewers from all over Canada and U.S. Most will charge 1 token for a half glass or 2 for a full, but here's a little trick, always ask for a half glass they will always over pour. Or just say 'be generous' and they'll give you more anyways. They always want you to be happy and to enjoy yourself. \n\nIf you are cold then no worries, they have the Steam Whistle brewery for you to go into to warm up. There is a washroom there which is usually the longer line since it's indoor. If you want a quicker washroom line then go to the portal potties located to the left of the Steam Whistle. \n\nThey have live DJ's performing with a dance area and lots of heated lamps or isolated camp fires for you to keep warm. \n\nI definitely enjoyed my time there and would recommend going each year. Just come early or buy your tickets early and get ready for the cold. \n\nCheers!!","10312":"Excellent hands down.   Reasonably priced, great staff, and good food.     I had the southwest chicken sandwich and the handcut curly fries which were both extraordinary.    I needed to grab food fast and literally just drove by and stopped.   I wasn't familiar with the area or even had time to check others reviews, but this by far exceeded my expectations.   \n\nMy friend that lives in the area says they have an excellent burger.  Unfortunately I'm out of time and will no be able to return.   I also heard sweet potato fries mentioned, which I would love to try.  \n\nStop in, you won't be disappointed :-)","10313":"i love staying at this all-suite hotel. i think their claim to fame is that they have the highest average square footage for their rooms. i think their sleeping rooms are better than the bellagio - which is a comparable price. the venetian has great places to eat, shop, and be merry. if you have time, check out the canyon ranch spa, jimmy choo, and one of the yummy italian places in \"st mark's square\".","10314":"Let me start by saying I am a licensed stylist (not practicing anymore but still licensed) since 1985 and I have super curly hair and I have never had a haircut that was specific to curly hair. Especially MY curly hair!  Kelly did an AMAZING job with my Deva Cut. I had it cut today and happen to go the professional beauty supply company right after and everyone there told me how cute my hair was. Posted a pic on FB and got a ton of like, loves and great comments. If you are looking for someone who REALLY knows how to handle curly hair Kelly is your girl! So glad I found her!! And the studio is super cute! I wish I could post a pic here!!","10315":"My family and I loved the food. We've been twice and each time had a great experience. Glad to have some variety in the Fort Mill area.","10316":"Been a bunch of times on their Thursday night parties but had never eaten there until last night. \n\nI was surprised to see one of my old friends serving us. All waitresses are mega hot. It's a little confusing that they all serve you (or not), no one has a specific table or area so I had to chase a waitress around for my side of hot peppers (I put hot peppers on EVERYTHING). \n\nI ordered the parpadelle with sausage and rapini dish. I was really good but I barely touched it because I usually lose my appetite when loud house is blasting, liquor pouring and people dancing around me. \n\nIt's a sexy crowd (although I was disgusted by a few old italian men with way too much gel in their hair and their 80s dance moves), sexy place, it's all hot pink. \n\nWe were 5 people, i don't know what our bill was because my buddy was kind enough to take care of it. But I looked at the menu and it was pricey. Not sure if it's worth it, but at least try it once.","10317":"So I was passing by, and my husband and I decided to try this new place, the services was super slow and it seems like the people that was there couldn't speak English, I have to repeat myself over and over, and they screwed my order at the end. I don't think that I will be back here.","10318":"This place is to die for!!!!! I went there 2 days in a row, dinner & early lunch before my flight home because I couldn't get enough. Service is outstanding as well! This place is a must!!!!","10319":"I would like to say that this was good, because the service was much friendlier than I ever experience at airport foodservice outlets, but the breakfast burrito this morning was a real letdown. The biggest issue was the temperature of the eggs and sausage (held on a steam table before building the burrito) were lukewarm, and so, when we got our food, the whole burrito was lukewarm and unappetizing. Again, though, I must say that the ladies behind the counter (one Filipina and one African American) were both all smiles and friendly, even though they were obviously stuck in the breakfast rush of a bunch of businessmen trying to make flights...","10320":"The first time I hear the name, I thought it is one of those scam restaurants opened by Chinese that can not make Japanese food. It was a pleasant surprise to find out this little cozy restaurant was runned by Japanese and delivers authentic Japanese food. Strongly recommend everyone to eat the dinner special as it is cheap and delicious. It is a little restaurant located on Baldwin Village, I decided to give it a try because I am sick of going to Kinton. The Chirashi (sashimi on rice) portion was huge and all the fish were very fresh. I was too full to have dessert because the Chirashi was that good, I felt the need to finish the whole bowl.","10321":"Yum although not perfect this time -- appetizer was cold (wasn't supposed to ) and ordered risotto was only a so-so.","10322":"I love this place. I'm a chinese-american, and it feels so authentic and homey whenever I go. I've gotten multiple noodle dishes, and they're all great. Of course, the soup dumplings are a must! I think you could order anything from this menu and it'd be top quality.","10323":"The Speedee Mart is located immediately right next door to the Embassy Suites hotel on Paradise Road.\n\nIt has way more selection than the Gift Shop located inside the Embassy Suites - and is cheaper as well.\n\nAll of your normal convenience store goodness is here: cold soda and beer, bottled water, snacks, coffee, toiletries, and other supplies. As well as a gas station.\n\nI noted as I walked in the front door - a sign that states: \"Please remove hoods when entering store\" or something like that.\n\nLas Vegas - a dangerous place!","10324":"Modern, clean facilities with a great view of chefs creating hand made noodles and dumplings. We ordered various potstickers and steamed dumplings, all of which were excellent and delicious.  Staff was kind and attentive. We will likely be back, and with friends.","10325":"Love my apartment and all the staff. Everyone who works here is very friendly and helpful. It is great to have your own private yard.","10326":"Having been here on many occasions, I can say it definitely doesn't disappoint. Although rather pricey for a cupcake, the taste is quite divine. The cake is spongy and moist while the buttercream is smooth and flavourful. I have yet to try all the varieties, but my favourite go to flavour is the crave-o-licious. Since I've been scaling back on my sugar intake the past year or two, I did find their cupcakes to be really, really sweet by the time you're half way through one so I would recommend buying the mini ones instead. Overall, a good place to go to if you're craving something sweet.","10327":"I wasn't sure what to think of this place or the idea of an escape room before we got there, but once we were in the room and trying to get out, I was all in! The place looks like an older house of some sort and not much to it, but they did a great job of making rooms challenging yet fun- for a family full 1 under the age of 10 to a couple above 50. We sometimes had to wait a little to get the clue that we were asking for but successfully escaped the Dr. Jones room. Fun was had by all, and it left me wanting to conquer another room!","10328":"Fast, convenient, and very efficient!\n\nRespectful and friendly staff!\n\nReasonable price!\n\nVincent is awesome! He even fixed my mistakes with another furniture that I tried to put together. Haha\n\nGrateful and appreciative client here!","10329":"First time coming to this place, disappointed in the customer service. Other than that, food was great.","10330":"We checked out the newest restaurant of the Norterra area, the Texas Roadhouse. From the moment you walk in, you are treated like royalty. Greeted at the door, greeted at the hostess counter, and quickly taken to a table. Our sever was Hawley, and she was perfect! Our waters, cocktails, and bread never sat empty. Her knowledge of menu was appreciated as it was our first time, and she gave some great recommendations. The food was fresh and hot. It really feels like a team atmosphere with the staff. Every so often you get a little entertainment with a line dance. Go check it out. Don't let the parking lot fool you, because the theatre can take up allot of the spaces. This is a large restaurant it would take an army to fill it. Enjoy!!","10331":"Services seemed ok till I asked for an extra plate. Originally asked for it when we ordered. When the assistant brought the food I waited for him to come back with one and he didn't. Got his attention and asked for an extra plate. He acknowledged me and continued prepping tables for new customers. After two tables I asked him again and he acknowledged me. After TWO more tables, and me getting upset, he finally went and got one. \n\nThe menu is a pain to look at. Pumpkin pancakes were ok\/good. Potatoes were bland. Overall wasn't worth it and wouldn't come back.","10332":"vegan diner food, served with diner attitude, yay!  \nfries, burgers, fusion, tsoynamis....\nthey have some grocery stuff, baked goods and fancy bottled drinks for sale as well.","10333":"Getting to and from the entrance of this store is an anxiety attack plus.. I feel like this business is run by a country that hates us. Service reps can be good or not caring (luck of the draw) The secice agents all have that same middle eastern look.","10334":"We had so much fun! There were 9 of us that did the Breakout Room ranging from ages 15-69, and we all contributed something! Such a great family experience. Puzzles were hard, but not too hard. We escaped with time to spare. Then 5 of us stayed and played The Writers Cabin. Again challenging puzzles, but as long as we all worked together we figured it out. We only had 6 seconds left!!!! Would totally recommend this for anyone who loves puzzles and escape rooms.","10335":"Why did the chicken cross the road? \nTo get to Blue Ribbon, of course! \n\nThis is an order-and-pay-then-seat-yourself-and-they'll-bring-you-the-food kind of place. A cross between \"fast food\" and \"restaurant\". \n\nIt's southern style comfort food, with lots of condiments to choose from in a casual, kid-friendly environment.","10336":"The staff is so unprepared, so rude and disorganized. They have no customer service whatsoever. I have been in many different places and this is the worst of all of them. Yesterday was my wife and I first time in this place because a famous Venezuelan comedian was presenting for the first time in Las Vegas. We tried to order some the waitress and one of the staff, who was passing by, mentioned that they don't have that item that we were ordering. So I decided to order something else. 30 min passed by, I went to the waitress and ask for our food, she mentioned that she would check in the kitchen, which she never did. 10 min later, passed and I ask another waiter to check on our order and no response. We decided to talk to the \"manager\" to find out what was going on, and found out that the items that we ordered were run out as well. Instead of apologizing which we would have  gladly accepted, the \"manager\" started arguing with us. Tried to talk to the \"owner\", he seemed so incompetent because he didn't say a word. We understand they could have some misunderstanding but not true because at the end of the event, the staff including the manager were so eager to clean everything, that took my unfinished drink and toss it out. Again, instead of apologizing, offered another drink and let us know to move to different table, he started arguing with me. My wife and I are easy going and barely complaint much but this place is the worst of all. No customer service, the prices of everything are extremely high, food is average bar type food. Nothing impressive.","10337":"We were thrilled to get a last minute reservation on Valentines Day. Our experience started off with our incredible server-wish I could remember his name! He was knowledgable about the menu and his recommendations were spot on to each of our tastes.\n\nWe started with the zucchini fritters. They were unique in that they had cheese inside but could have used a bit more seasoning--but nothing that the delicious aioli couldn't fix!\n\nFor my main I ordered the sweet potato tortelli. It was a dish that intrigued me from the menu and our server recommended it as well. It was good but in my opinion could have used sage to give the dish more flavor. My husband got the short ribs stew which he raved about. The cornbread that came with the stew was so good, not too dry and just enough kick from the peppers inside. \n\nWe finished with dessert which were perfectly portioned. We split the cheesecake which was to die for and the chocolate cake that was great as well.","10338":"Been to this location several times and it definitely a locals spot to eat. It's very mom and pop feel and they have a pretty varied menu, which was surprising to me.  We had their Mother's Day breakfast buffet several months back, and I have also had their spaghetti (which I've ordered on multiple occasions) - everything was tasty and service has been good each time as well. \n\nMy parents have already mentioned visiting this restaurant again when they come back for a visit - so I think that speaks to their verdict on the place!\n\nOverall: A\nA good place to grab a bite if you are in the area.  It isn't anything fancy, but the food is tasty!","10339":"I'm always on the hunt for a great ice cream. I ran into this place by accident and now I'm a regular. Family-owned and operated multiple flavors with fruit inside.. Yummy!","10340":"I first went to Romados two summers ago and I have been craving it ever since.  The service is very quick and the staff is VERY polite and friendly- you feel like you've been friends with them for years.  As for the food- I LOVE chicken and this is some of the best chicken you can find anywhere in Montreal.  The prices are unbelievable with the most expensive menu item being a large side portion of rice for $13.50.  We got the meal combos that included the 1\/2 chicken, fries, salad and rice and it was under $10!!  You can decide if you want the chicken to be spicy or not too.  I got it spicy and it was the perfect amount of added heat to add a real kick to the meal. We then walked down the street and enjoyed our meal at the small park that is close by.  It was perfect and I can't wait to go back.","10341":"News flash,\nDo you crave good fast food for lunch?  Try the call ahead option.  Talked to Kelly to let her know I would be there in 10 minutes with not much time to spare.  I selected from their lunch menu on the website - Great Deals!!! and viola!!!  There was my food right after getting settled.  I appreciate the good service as well.\nListen up everyone - try it, you'll like it.","10342":"Solid 4 Stars...When leaving the establishment, my rating was going to be a 3 1\/2 Stars however the additonal 1\/2 star came from our server who gave me boiled peanuts to go. He apologized that my fried saimin was not served to me in a timely manner. We were done eating our fiod and he noticed I didn't have my fried saimin. \n\nHere's my story... let me start by saying I'm from the 808- exit 8 home of the best meat jun in Wahiawa Hawaii. With that said i know meat jun and know how one should taste. The meat jun here is not bad at all. Best so far on the mainland. I think the dipping sauce could've been a little better but hey it's still good. \n\nWe arrived here around 2pm on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was busy but glad they had large party tables available. We had 8 of us total. \n\nThe server was very nice and served the table ban chan and boiled peanuts. The peanuts and cucumber kim chee was the bomb. \n\nIn addition to my meat jun order, i had the fried saimin and kalbi. Omg, broke da mouth fo realz. The fried saimin was on point. Lots of flavor and made with fish cake. Yay! \n\nAlthough they forgot about my fried saimin, it was actually worth the wait. I'm excited to visit again. \n\nAfter viewing the menu, this is a Korean Restaurant serving Hawaii style dishes. Felt like I was eating food on Kapiolani Blvd back home. \n\nDefinitely a place you gotta check out.","10343":"Amazing place with amazing shots for amazing prices. Oh and amazing staff foods good too. BEER AND SHOTS FOR $2!!! music could be better though. But I totally recommend!!","10344":"We were in a hurry and bought prepared food from there Saturday night January 31st. I ate pepperoni pizza and became violently ill. Stomach cramps and then lost everything on Sunday.  I am certain that this is stomach flu not only food poisoning.  I had stomach flu in college.  I know the difference.  Super bowl Sunday was ruined.  I have never eaten their prepared food. I never will eat or shop there at that location.  I am from Austin.  I know and like whole foods,  but this place is terrible.  Dont eat there! Ever!","10345":"We are always hesitant to try steak chains, but Fleming's did a good job. The bread and cheese spreads were delicious; it could be a meal in itself. We started off with shrimp cocktail. Very good. I had the classic Caesar which was a very large salad. I shared over half of it with my husband. He had the prime bone in ribeye and was cooked to perfection! He said it was done perfect and had wonderful flavor. I had the Lobster tail which was very good. We shared a side of the mashed potatoes with blue cheese melted instead of butter, I would go back just for those! We had a very nice bottle of wine. I must say that they have an incredible wine selection. The waiter was very friendly and the decor was nice.","10346":"Over the past 30 years I have bought and sold several houses. I never got the sense the realtors deserved their commissions. Not until Sandy sold a townhouse for me did I experience a realtor with the dedication, enthusiasm and knowledge that commands respect and gratitude. \n\nSandy don't play. She is all business all the time. I appreciated her intelligent, no-nonsense focus on my sale. With multiple offers, she helped me navigate my way to a completed sale in 90 days; and that was during a dip in the market.  The other factor was that everything was done long distance because I live out of state and never met her. \n\nWith Sandy you get a twofer: she is both a realtor and an appraiser.  What more can you ask for?","10347":"Good place for a Japanese buffet. Just some waitress get confuse and bring orders from different table but is not a huge problem cause when I was there was really packed. Anyways. Very tasteful and really good sashimi.","10348":"Delicious buffet.  When I went with a colleague, it was $9.99 for an all you can eat buffet that included around 8-10 dishes, plus dessert.\n\nGreat value, and a clean and bright atmosphere.","10349":"Wednesday, January 15, we had a reservation at our favorite restaurant to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary.  We were so right when we booked our reservation at Vaccaro's.  We requested to have our favorite waiter, Bill.  Bill was amazing.  He had the table set up especially nice for us - chair covers, special candle he purchased and a card from him too!  We felt like royalty.  We decided to do the 4 course wine tasting menu.  Chef Dick came out to talk to us at the beginning of our meal to discuss our likes\/dislikes and also to tell us he'd be doing 5 courses instead of 4.  He was going to start us out with a cheese course to nibble.  Raphael carefully chose each wine to accompany each course and they were all perfect.  The cheese course was wonderful.  This was a special treat for us since our trip to France this year where we learned a lot about cheese.  Then came our appetizer course, scallops with pork belly, a very unique dish  - and I know I'm not describing it properly, but let me just say - AMAZING!  The salad course was just as unique.  It had oats and dried cranberries and was just so refreshing.  Our main course was exceptionally special as they served us Kobe beef with double baked potatoes (the best I think I've ever had) and asparagus.  Dessert was a trio of desserts: italian donuts (my husband's favorite), tiramisu, and creme br\u00c3\u00bbl\u00c3\u00a9e on steroids!  We especially need to send a huge shout out to Bill, because he was instrumental in making sure our dining experience was over the top, to Chef Dick for such an amazing meal and to Raphael who even danced at our table!  Thank you Vaccaro's for making our special night even more special!","10350":"I came here with my husband and a few of his business partners. There was a convention in town so the only reservation I could get was for 8:30 which was very early for Vegas. We wer the only ones in the restaurant as we were seated. We started off with dirty martinis and they were made to perfection. The waiter was attentive, explained the menu and answered any of our questions. We ordered a little bit of everything and there was nothing that we did not like. As the night went on, a few more martinis we got a little louder but the waiter kept up with us. At the end of the night the chef even brought us a sample of desserts and took  a picture with me. Can't wait to go back. Great 5 star experience!","10351":"So, we decided to forget about watching what we eat and ate 4 appetizers, tapas style, and topped it off with the dessert trio.... out of all 7 items I must say that they deserve 10 stars out of 5. Amazing food, well prepared and presented..... and the servers are up to par to the food.... the ambiance is perfect.... I highly recommend this place....","10352":"this company is very miss leading, the advertise $25.00 repair & service.\ni sent the my ipod touch with a cracked screen, they sent me a bill for a screen for $79.00 & head phone jack for $19.99. \nthere was nothing wrong with the phone jack when i sent it in, this is a complete up sale.\ni am sure they are good at what they do, but their site is miss leading. call first make sure they give you complete prices upfront before whip your product all the way to new jersey, you might find your local repai center is the same price or cheaper","10353":"THEhotel, the sister hotel to Mandalay Bay, was slightly disappointing.  Although I really liked the modern decor and large rooms, there were a few downsides that were quite unpleasant.  First of all, the whole hotel reeked of sulfur, from the lobby to the hallways.  I'm not sure what the cause of that smell was but it was pretty disgusting.  Luckily the smell wasn't in our room!  The rooms are spacious but the beds are not very comfortable.  Even though it was nice that the hotel didn't have a casino, thus no smoke, it would have been convenient to have its own pool.  If you want to go to the pool, its a 10-15 minute walk from the bottom of the elevators.  Overall, it's not the best hotel, and I probably won't be returning.","10354":"The service here was very professionally delivered. Anthony was so very curteous and knowledgeable.","10355":"$7.59 for an unsatisfying, not thick chocolate milkshake...I don't think so.  It tastes like they put half a scoop of ice cream and 2 cups of milk.  High price + low-quality equals horrible.  \n\nDrinks come in only one size to force you to buy the expensive one. \n\nThe Ben & Jerry's name no longer carries value in the retail space.  McDonald's has a better tasting chocolate shake than B&J. \n\nIf you want to waste your money come here.","10356":"We had an awesome experience with Ocean Furniture!\n\nMy girlfriend and I were in need of a new couch, and after a bit of searching I found Ocean here on Yelp. Based on the other reviews, we decided to visit the store we're very happy we did. Ken is the owner of the business and we really enjoyed working with him. He listened to what we were looking for and had a great selection for us to choose from.\n\nWe ended up purchasing a nice sectional and, as part of a promotion, Ken offered us a great 3 piece coffee\/end table set. When the furniture was delivered, Ken and his crew setup our furniture quickly and made sure we were happy with our configuration. I'd also like to note that one of the end tables had a small defect on it, which Ken brought to our attention before he even unloaded the truck. I was even more impressed with Ken's service when he worked with his supplier and got us a replacement table top under warranty and came to replace it a few days later.\n\nWe've had the furniture for about a month and a half and we couldn't be happier with our purchase. Thanks Ken!","10357":"Loved everything about my experiences here. I bought my wedding dress here and all my bridesmaids' dresses. Everyone was very kind, helpful, and professional. Great prices and beautiful dresses. Never had one problem through all the dress-choosing, fittings, etc.","10358":"Amazing brisket tacos. I live across the street, and this is just the thing I need late at night when I am looking for something that isn't pizza or poutine.","10359":"I have been here a few times now and have had a wonder experience each time! Not only do I adore the compassion of this restaurant but the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. All my meals here have been delicious! Not the mention the dessert is amazing! So grateful to have a restaurant that serves vegan sweets so close to my home! Wish there was more restaurants like this one","10360":"The restaurants was clean - Service was super friendly. \n\nThe variety of donuts are amazing - The donuts are amazing in taste not for calorie counters.","10361":"This place says it's open till 9pm, the waitress started by telling us all the things that were unavailable on the menu. We got here at 7:45 and ordered bruschetta to start,the waitress said the kitchen was closing so she would \"see if they could make it\", she said yes, but they would have to cut everything up from scratch. Um okay. They started putting up the chairs around us, it's now 8:20 mind you they close at 9, another couple came in and were told the kitchen was closed that the only thing they could have was pizza. Bad business, making your customers walk out and rushing the ones that were there.","10362":"OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed...\n\nReview #32:\nthe closest major casino to mi casa; a worthy solid mid-scale bet; focuses on the locals trade with tons of slot machines; adjoined to a huge Bass Pro Shop, complete with massive waterfalls, lagoons, and fish (some of which are huge!); the Mermaid Lounge has the unique feature of a giant cylindrical fish tank that you can walk around and gawk at, and sometimes see human \"mermaids\" taking a swim; the small lounge \/ sports bar features an Airsrtream trailer converted into a mini-bowling alley; great happy hour specials (both early and late) at Twin Creeks steakhouse; the outdoor pool is small, but the surrounding cabana area is nicer than you'd expect; this place rates 3.5 stars, but I don't think it's worthy of 4, so they only get 3 on the Yelp scale; best craft beer bet = it's really lacking; the best you can do is Sin City amber & IPA on tap at a few of the bars","10363":"The fish and chips here are surprisingly awesome.  They make them on the spot and so they are fresh and tasty.  Be warned though, they do take forever. I once had to wait close to an hour for mine. That is ridiculous, in my opinion, but once I tried the fish I forgot about the wait.\n\nI usually go with the fish and chips but they also have a pretty good burger. I have yet to try any of their sandwiches but they look good.\n\nService is spotty, at best. Aside from the aforementioned long waits for food, they once charged me for my food, and while I was waiting said they made a mistake and asked me for an extra $6 bucks. I was like wtf. Turns out they were right but that is annoying. Get it right the first time!","10364":"We had heard how good this place was and got to the airport a little early so decided to partake while we waited for our plane. It was quite busy, but we were seated quickly and the waiter promptly greeted us and took our drink order. When he returned with our drinks we were ready to order our food. We ordered a couple of different pies (pizza) to share. One came out fairly quickly but the other was missing. Our waiter, Ryan, quickly realized the oversight and addressed it directly by apologizing and promising to get the other pie out as quickly as possible. After a few minutes our pie still hadn't arrived and our waiter told us he was still working on it and would take care of us. A couple of minutes later he delivered the other pie and also brought his manager by to also apologize and let us know that they would comp both pies. It was unfortunate we had this mixup, but they handled it directly and graciously and you can't ask for better than that! To top it off the pies and the drinks were delicious!! I will definitely be back next time I'm in the Phoenix area!!","10365":"The agent Nga allowed my family to miss out on a house due to unprofessional behavior! My name was ran through public records, and it just so happens to be a very common name. Without using a middle initial pulled up multiple public records and before asking for proof submitted by my agent or myself submitted that to the homeowner who then denied my application! These public records were not even me! On top of that I followed all the instructions that were asked of me and STILL was denied due to the lack or proactivity from this agent. I am is shock at the negligence of this agent. Now I've lost a home for my daughters and myself and am stuck in a unhealthy environment with them.","10366":"Every time I go to Vegas I must come to Olive Garden!  We went for a late lunch this past Sunday ( 3pm ) and I was surprised to see that they were busy.  I had the spaghetti with Italian sausage and of course we had to have those little donuts with the chocolate sauce!  Yummy.  We had a very funny waitress.  My only complaint is that we don't have an Olive Garden in Hawaii, not fair!!!  can't wait till we go back.","10367":"The burgers here are so yummy . They have a pretty wide variety of beers as well . Pretty good place to hangout with friends !","10368":"Thought it was a restutant, it's a decent place though. Gotta eat here bc of the name. Not much seating menu is very small, you order and sit.","10369":"The location at WT Harris and Statesville Road is like the cafeteria for our office staff.  I'm in there at least twice a week. Had lunch there today in fact.\n\nGood enough beer list, good enough food, good enough service so we keep coming back.  Mostly because it's accross the street from the office and therefore really handy for lunch or after work.  \n\nOyster night (Thursdays) is a great deal.  Pint night on Tuesdays is great too.","10370":"One of our absolute favorite sushi places in the North Hills. We come here a few times a year. Tonight we tried a few new dishes - the vegetable gyoza and the Beauty Alaska Roll - as well as our favorite Rainbow Roll and a few sushi pieces of salmon and tuna.\n\nThe gyoza was excellent! It was delicate and perfectly crunchy with the right ratio of vegetable filling that balanced well with the dipping sauce.\n\nI have to say the new Beauty Alaska Roll, with its crown of delightful tiny black roe that was neither too salty nor too fishy, and its spicy filling with salmon was OUTSTANDING. Really tremendous flavor and texture. \n\nOf course the rainbow roll was great as always too. Great meal again.","10371":"The meatballs are exceptional,  and the pizza with pear and gorgonzola was so delicious.  Was with a large party and the service was great.  Spaghetti sauce is slightly sweet,  so if that's not your bag,  consider requesting an arrabiata sauce.  Dessert is worth it, the chocolate cake is fantastic,  as is the wedding cake and tiramisu. It's pricey so come prepared.","10372":"My friend took me there for my first Pilipino food experience. It was great. The owner served us herself, the food was delicious. Will definitely come back.","10373":"Best, most flavorful Chicken Quesadilla we ever had! Mesquite grilled chicken with Mozzarella cheese. Fresh salsa bar where you select your toppings ( freshly made Pico De Gallo for example ). Don't expect to be able to eat inside. This place is very busy and they only have 5 tables. There are a couple of tables outside, if it's not too hot out.","10374":"I decided to swing by to buy a few medium sized mid priced cigars since I live around the corner. I spent $15 on 3 cigars. Sad to say that even though the cigars were kept in a cabinet humidor that they were dry as a bone when I got them home. I smoked one about 10 minutes after buying it and while cutting the cigar it crunched and practically shattered. After lighting up the cigar the wrapper flaked off, it burned incredibly hot and unevenly and was so bitter that I couldn't finish it. Too bad since they are so close to home, but I'll be traveling elsewhere from now on.","10375":"I hate buffets. I almost never I try a buffet that is even remotely passable in terms of quality, taste and preparation. The Buffet at the Bellagio is one of those exceptions; in fact it by far surpasses any buffet I have ever found. \n\nHere you will find a huge selection of food, anything from beef, pork, lamb, seafood and even vegetarian. Everything I sampled would rival entrees from most any sit down restaurant you will find. For me the highlight was the Alaskan King Crab legs, they were perfectly cooked, large, meaty and pre-split. It's rare that I find crab of this quality. I find the prime rib equally prepared, cooked to a perfectly medium rare. The various pork and chicken dishes were excellent. Of the vegetable sides I sampled the mashed potatoes (real potatoes), green beans, corn, salad, etc., all were delicious. Of the few breads I sampled were also very good. In short this was a buffet that really was one of the best meals I had had in quite a while, I left satisfied and overstuffed. \n\nNow the bad, at just under $40 it's quite expensive. It's also a good idea to try and arrive just about opening, the lines can get quite long. Given the quality and variety of food it really isn't a bad deal in my view. Just make sure you're hungry when you go. For a buffet The Buffet it's as good as it gets.","10376":"Great combination of flavors, textures, fresh\/local ingredients, and great service.","10377":"If you're a Packers fan then this is the bar for you on football Sundays! If you are not a Packers fan it's still a great bar any day. When I found this bar\/restaurant for my cheesehead girlfriend a couple years ago, we were both surprised to discover what a fun atmosphere and delicious food it provided. \n\nPretty much every dish I've tried has been great. The prices are good and they offer many drink and food specials throughout the week. My top recommendation is the cheesesteak (and I'm from the Philly area). It is the best I've had in the Phoenix metro area and I've tried a number of places. Also surprising was the Mexican food here is good too and one of the nights they offer them at half off.","10378":"Friday night's is seafood night for $27, but you can get a couple bucks off if you have a players card. The food was okay but better than I expected. I indulged in mounds of crab legs. They were on par with what you'd find at another buffet. The kalua pig and cabbage was tasty but the rice was dry. Manapua's were dry as well. They even had oysters. I was a bit skeptical so I only had 2. They were actually all right. The fried chicken was amazing! Seriously, if I were 50 years older with no shame, I'd probably stash some in my purse for later. \n\nOverall, it's your standard casino buffet. They cater a bit to the Hawaiian clientele so you'll find a few Hawaiian dishes. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but it's a good option if you're looking for a buffet downtown.","10379":"Just came here yesterday on one of the first nice patio days of the year. Was impressed that the inside of the restaurant was almost as inviting as the patio.  Was also impressed that the value \/ pricing was much better than it could've been for such a great location literally right on the water. \n\nWe just had drinks and an app but the service was very professional and everything was quite good. Local beer and two types of Sangria with baked brie is my perfect idea of a spring patio day! \n\nWill hopefully be back soon to try a full meal; especially with their good selection of seafood dishes which I love!","10380":"Food was amazing and don't get me wrong about service. The waitress who waited us was wonderful. But the person who seated us was a little rude. We have 3 kids under 7yrs old and they were pretty excited about the place but then when they were seating us the person seating us yelled at our kids and said that they needed to quite down but for us our kids weren't very loud compared to those who were in the restaurant yelling swear words drunk. Hype person who seated us said to our kids there is no yelling, no cursing and no getting crazy. I was furious but didn't make a statement because I know our kids wouldn't do that and they know not to be rude and yell out bad words. They were being kids excited to eat. Like said, food was great but probably not was a great idea taking kids.","10381":"What can we say? It's always been the one true home for Rocky Horror in Las Vegas. Ever since Regency took over the place and brought it back from the dead a few years back, the place hasn't looked as good in such a long time. We draw great crowds for our show, the staff has been great, the hot dogs are damn good for a dollar, and you can't beat $1.50 movies (Or $9 for Rocky Horror). Remember, it's the experience of seeing it on a big screen! And thanks to everyone out there who have been coming out to the theater and keeping it going!","10382":"Awesome food! The side dishes are yummy and the bbq was great, too. I came here with one of my college classes so we were limited only 4 meats but everything we tried was really good. I've always passed by this place but now that I've tried it, I will definitely be back!","10383":"So glad I found this place, from reading the previous reviews it's no wonder that it's a hidden secret.  Originally this place was meant for Scotia Bank employees as they used to ask for proof of ID, however times have changed and its hush hush.....as long as you look, dress and act the part you can blend in with the Scotia staff :) \nIf you're looking for a fancy place, look elsewhere for the Clipper Cafe....KEY WORD..\"CAFE\" says it all. It's your traditional high school-looking place that's serving some comfort food from chicken, mash potatoes, and beef dishes to egg plant parmigiana, burgers, soups and stir fry. \nWhat makes this place a steal are its food choices (some of its outsourced food) and prices.  I mean where in the financial district can you get a full meal (drink and dessert) for under $8? Nowhere!\nI had their eggplant parmigiana with broccoli and rice, which was OKAY, and for dessert I had their cinnamon coffee cake with a bottle of Eska water. \nIn there seating area its comfy and simple, and most of all, clean.  They also have staff that walk around periodically cleaning up tables and removing trays, which is always a personal touch.\n\nPros:\n-Cheap eats\n-Clean\n-Choice of foods.\n\nCons:\n-Quality","10384":"This is the worst McDonald's, and restaurant I have ever visited.  And after speaking to two managers to try to solve the issue, it was like they didn't even care.  \n\nThis is a busy location right on the highway.  I received my drive thru order and proceeded to the highway and shortly after noticed several items were missing.  \n\nI called the store and they told me I had to come back to the store for a refund.  I was already gone down the highway.\n\nI will remove this review if the owner of the restaurant contacts me and sends me a cheque for $2.69.","10385":"Got there around 8pm and they were packed!!!  All the tables inside were full and the tables outside were full.  CRAZY!  \n\nThey had 3 employees working so the line flowed steady.  We got our ice cream to go, since the place was packed.  \n\nStore the clean, employees are friendly, and the ice cream is good!","10386":"Very cute spot with vintage decoration and great service but the ice cream tastes store bought. I think if you're going to charge $3.50 for a scoop, it should be freshly made in your large kitchen. I don't see this place lasting very long unless quality control is stepped up.","10387":"Every single time I come in to town(which is often) I hit this place. \n\nWhether it be for breakfast, lunch or a quick pick up order of spam musubi, their food is always good. The last time I came I had a moco loco and dang near passed out from a food coma because the serving was so much and was so good that I couldn't stop eating. Being Filipino, a lot of their dishes are similar to what I can make already but why go through the effort of having to make it myself when I'm on vacation and someone else can make it just as good?\n\nAdd to the fact that I can get my fix of Lilikoi here makes my decision just that easier. The proprietors here are so friendly - I always seem to talk to the one gentleman with the goatee. I swear if this is how all people from Hawaii are(friendly and conversational) I really need to book my trip there now. \n\nI'm sure they remember me - I always order at least 10 spam musubis for pickup.","10388":"They were off tonight. For some reason they were really slow and not as pleasant as usual.  I will come back of course.  Just goes to show that nobody is perfect.  I was starting to think this location was. I ordered a white chocolate latte and is wasn't as good as usual.  They made my husband's drink a small instead of medium. Maybe it was just a case of the after Christmas blues.","10389":"Great people making amazing pizza.  Get the Presto Pesto with chicken!  I could eat this everyday.","10390":"Listen, I've written enough reviews about the many Filiberto's across the valley that I would be regurgitating old stuff over and over again. Seriously though, I've been to about 5 of them in AZ, and after moving to Boston I'm kind of hoping that AZ might be willing to donate me a Filiberto's. \n\nThere is nothing like it anywhere. I used to be skeptical about this place, but then I tried it, and I've been addicted since. Sadly enough, because of my closed mind, I only got to have it for the last 3 out of the 22 years I was in Phoenix.\n\nIf you're a snob who likes to eat arugula salads with steamed fish or some other healthy food, don't come here. If you're a Chipotle snob, don't come here. Don't get me wrong, I love Chipotle, but Filiberto's is just different.","10391":"What's not to like about ice cream?  Good selection of ice creams.  Staff is usually pleasant with a side of apathy thrown in depending on what time it is.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is it just looks dirty in there.  I never want to stay inside.","10392":"Un des meilleurs restaurants de Montr\u00c3\u00a9al! Les plats sont raffin\u00c3\u00a9s et le service est impeccable. \nCertes un peu cher mais cela vaut vraiment la peine. Vous \u00c3\u00aates de passage \u00c3\u00a0 Montr\u00c3\u00a9al, il faut s'arr\u00c3\u00aater souper Chez l'\u00c3\u00a9picier!\nC'est celui que j'ai pr\u00c3\u00a9f\u00c3\u00a8r\u00c3\u00a9!","10393":"Was here for breakfast and lunch at two different times. Very small place packed with people most of the times. Especially during a weekend, it is reasonable to expect a wait time of 10-15 minutes. \n\nI ordered spinach and feta with eggs the first time. It is good. Their crepes are thick and well cooked. They serve it with a salad and it is usually fresh. My friends ordered the Alaskan and chicken (Marseille) crepes both of which they thought are tastier than the spinach and feta. So, if you are not a vegetarian, you might want to consider ordering those over the vegetarian options. \n\nThe second time, I started with a cup of Cappuccino and I am pleasantly surprised by the creaminess. This time I ordered the Tivoli which is served with tomatoe pesto, spinach and mozarella. By the way, tomatoe pesto is also used in alaskan crepe and it is delicious. \n\nI will go back again and try the Alaskan or Marseille crepes next time. Very good place for both vegetarian and meat eaters when it comes to savory crepes.","10394":"The food was amazing, the wine awesome, and our waiter Candace was the best!! Highly recommend this restaurant.. Come in and request Candace","10395":"RM stands for Rick Moonen, one of New York's premier seafood chefs, who moved to Vegas to actually run this restaurant.\r\n\r\nThe top floor is the fine dining area, designed to resemble a luxury yacht.  This is where our group enjoyed a spectacular meal with perfect presentation and service.  I'm remembering fondly the seared tuna, clam chowder, and oyster shooters dressed with gazpacho...\r\n\r\nThe ground-floor casual eatery (r bar cafe) is a modern seafood brasserie ideal for light meals and offers a raw bar menu and regional delights such as Louisiana shrimp po' boys, Manhattan clam chowder, Maryland crab cakes and a biscuit bar.  I've had lunch here every time I've attended a conference at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center.  It's a perfect place to meet clients, right outside the showfloor entrance.","10396":"Chicken fried steak was to salty.  Texas breakfast didn't have much chorizo in it and kneaded more flavor.  Orange juice did not taste like it stated as fresh squeezed orange juice.","10397":"These guys moved into the old Camping World location. Glad they did. They are just around the corner from my office, and the two times I have popped in there for something ,they not only had what I needed, but had at a fair price. I needed an oddball thing, lock parts, and they had a used one that they sold me super cheap. Solved my problem and got me on my way.\n\nThe counter guys are the helpful type with a can do attitude. They also seem to be empowered to make the customer happy, like discount tire does. I do most of my own RV repairs, but when I need a pro, I'll bring it here.","10398":"This park has a lot going for it. It has a baseball field. It has a basketball court. It has a pretty nice walking trail which is also good for riding my bike on. It has an area for picnics and outdoor parties. There is a play set for little kids too.","10399":"I loved my stay at this hostel. It was right on the edge of Kensington Market and next to University of Toronto. There is a night club right next door to this hostel. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and the fellow backpackers were all very welcoming. The common areas of the hostel allowed for great conversations and meeting of interesting people. \n\nThe beds were good and clean. Lockers were provided in the bedrooms but you must bring your own lock. There was a nice balcony area but the view is not always something special. Mine overlooked a sitting between the surrounding buildings. \n\nBathrooms are clean and nice. One of the showers had a torn curtain but other than that everything was very modern and sleek in appearance. \n\nIn the kitchen, there is plenty of space for you to store your own food.","10400":"I have never been to El Hefe at night, only for lunch or early happy hours so my review is for the food an ambiance during the daytime. I come here often for lunch, they have great street tacos, salsas and quesadillas. The happy hour is spot on with both food and drink specials from 3-7pm. Taco Tuesdays have $2 tacos and the patio is awesome when the weather is nice. \n\nWhile I can't speak to the night time atmosphere this is a great spot to grab lunch or happy hour on Mill.","10401":"Read their reviews and looked up their website.  4 of us showed up today for brunch to a COMPLETELY empty restaurant.  We asked for the table in front next to the window.  Next thing we knew the rude hostess was ushering us to outside seating.  NOTE: it is cloudy and raining today.  The group consisted of 4 \/ 3 women in their 50's and 60's.  No one was interested in sitting outside on a day like this.  We again asked for the table inside the empty restaurant and she then told us that they were completely booked.  IT WAS COMPLETELY EMPTY.  I am assuming it was booked for a party or something, but shouldn't you post that on your Facebook page or on your website?  It was handled poorly by their staff and especially the hostess.  WOULD NOT EVEN CONSIDER RETURNING.  Guess what folks... great restaurants are a dime a dozen here in the Valley.  We walked without even looking back.","10402":"My friends and I stopped here after a baseball game at PNC Park. We were all looking to just relax and spend some time with each other. When we came across Hookah Bookah, it was the perfect solution. \n\nBefore I get into lots of detail, I just want to say the I really enjoyed my time here. This place is wonderful! My friends and I opted to try the mango flavored hookah... Absolutely amazing! So, so worth it! (None of us smoke outside of the occasional hookah.) We also took advantage of the available beverages. I was going to order a mango lasse, but sadly they were out of mango pulp, so I opted for a frozen chai later instead. It was delicious! I could definitely taste all the spices in it! \n\nThe whole place was quite relaxing. My friends and I took advantage of the leather seats. I enjoyed how spacious it was. Lots of seating. The large TVs were nice too! The staff were attentive and changed our coals often. \n\nOverall, this was a wonderful experience! I can't wait to return soon!!! (Hoping to get a mango lasse next time!)","10403":"Has an atmosphere for quietly reading or doing some work. Not a place you would want to bring friends to hangout in just because this location is pretty small. But it has a very warm and cozy touch to it.\n\nI had a cappuccino and it was great!","10404":"You know it was a bad meal when your server brings you the bill and says \"at least the bill came fast,\" then hovers over you watching you pay. Where was all this attention when we actually needed it?\n\nWe waited at the front for a while for a hostess. That was clue number one we should of left. We were seated and ordered our appetizers. They took 40 minutes just for 2 apps. Once they came out we then ordered our entrees so they'd be ready quicker. They took 30min.\nThe reason we went to Milestones was for their steaks. We were told they were out of steaks. I ordered the chicken club. I was then told they were out of the bread but could put it on a burger bun. My boyfriend ordered the burger. Food was dismal. Burger bun was too big for sandwich.\nThe apps were disappointing. We got the popcorn shrimp. It's a brown bag (looks cheap) with popcorn, then 6 little shrimps on top. Let's be real here, how much does popcorn cost? Next to nothing. They could of at least seasoned it. The fries as an app we wouldn't of ordered had we known we'd be getting the burgers with fries. \nWe agreed we could of gone to an actual burger place (The Works) for better burgers & service. \n\nHad they told us right away that they were behind in the kitchen, we could of left or been prepared. Had they told us they were out of steaks we could of left or decided to wait it out for a different meal. There was NO accommodation made to try to make up for them being out of steaks & bread. No apology. No manager came to our table to try to fix it.  We came in from the advertisement and we told too bad we're out. Feels like false advertising.","10405":"Ate lunch here on a late Sunday morning.  We opted for waiting the 5 minutes to miss the breakfast menu (ends at 11am) and get the lunch menu once I saw the kobe beef sliders on the lunch menu :-) \n\nMy husband and I were trying to \"keep it  light\" after gorging at Del Frisco's Steak House for dinner the night before.  Riiight...so we just ordered some apps and split them.    We had the kobe beef sliders - which were amazing.  I think I could eat 3 orders myself.  Then the coconut shrimp and the asian chicken lettuce wraps (nothing like at PF Chang's or Chinoix but good.)\n\nThey also had Bellinis on the menu which instantly makes the place a favorite as they made them right (unlike most places) - almost to Cipriani perfection. \n\nService was great.  The waiter was always there when needed but not obtrusive.\n\nThis is a great place to walk up to after lounging in the sun by the pool.  Cost is..well...its The Wynn so deal with it.","10406":"I like this place a lot, it is cute and cool, but the prices for wine are silly for S. American brands.  Your best bet here is to buy a bottle of something in the $27-$35 range rather than glass at a time for $12-$14.  Then if you don't finish it (you are going to finish it), take it with you.\n\nWe do love the back area, its very neat, one of the best patios in Phoenix and they're dog friendly.  Come in the morning for Coffee and Tammie Coe (YUM!) pastries.  They also serve MJ breads for their evening tapa style options.\n\nFor food, get an order of Bruschetta, its very nice and they have some very good food for the price.  This is where they shine - not with the wine, which is pretty good, just overpriced.  Their cheese platters are also quite good, well worth it.\n\nEach month they have a wine tasting with Kim Hartleroad, make sure you come in for that.  For $25 you get some nice snacks, 3 to 4 wines to taste and some great lessons from a local wine guru.\n\nIts very nice to have a place for evening tapas and wine as well as great options in the morning with Illy Coffee and Tammie Coe pastries.  They have a great place here, make sure you stop in, day or night!","10407":"This is a good place to stop if you're looking for a \"trendy\" bar & restaurant in Madison. The martini list is nice - the Hug (with fresh mango, orange juice and plenty of rum) was my favorite. I did notice that the accoustics in Crave weren't very good, so be prepared to say \"What?\" and \"Excuse Me?\" a LOT if the restaurant is busy! Food-wise, my portabella sandwich was very good, with lots of fresh ingredients... but the sweet potato fries were only so-so. I'll probably be back - just after 11pm next time, when they offer half-priced martinis.","10408":"Location is not ideal. Took me a minute to locate. Parking is not good. \nThe wait time just to check out is long. The overall wait time is quite long but it is expected for a medical office unfortunately. My total time there with appointment was exactly 2 hours. \n\nThe girl with glasses that took my vitals was GORGEOUS! I could stare at her all day! She was also very knowledgeable on everything I asked her. She made me feel conformable and had a kind welcoming vibe. I forgot her name but I could never forget her face. \n\nThe doctor was kind and I didn't feel rushed or overlooked here.","10409":"Check them out on meet up so Ted can help you ride that bike you bought! Road or MTB-- super knowledgable on trails and roads. Explains things and let's you make a choice if the path is right. Eases you into the sports... And then makes excellent suggestions. A plus owner ++++ loves bikes and getting others to love the sport too-- everyone get healthy and ride bikes! Thanks Ted for a tour of cottonwood","10410":"We love Cold Stone! Usually, we get good service at the Goodyear, AZ location. However, during this visit, the customer service person presented distracted, literally stared away from me while I was requesting my order and then left me hanging at the register when they completed one out of two of my orders. After waiting a few minutes, thinking that they were making the second order I requested, I approached them at the other end of the counter. They asked me, \"Did you have another order you wanted made?\" I told them, \"Yes, I did. I guess you forgot?\" and re-requested my second order. During the mixing of my order, I noticed this person rubbed their nose over my ice cream and had one hand that was dripping wet while mixing my order. When I see a restaurant with an \"A\" rating displayed from their recent safety inspection, like this Cold Stone Creamery presented, I admit, I expect to have my food made mindfully and representative of the rating they received.","10411":"Food was ok. Food was prepared as requested . Incorrect cheese used as well and then tried to tell us that it was correct cheese .   Over priced and not impressed .","10412":"Love the caramel chicken here.  It was busy. Nothing over the top, but good standard pei Wei!","10413":"This casino deserves a solid 5 star because of their beautiful aquarium and mermaid show! If you're into aquariums, this place has the most beautiful and one of a kind fishes. & the best part is that it's free! They host an awesome mermaid show daily. My daughter loves mermaids and sea animals, she is so into this place and the show just wows her every time. The vibes outside and inside the casino are great, reminds me of California.","10414":"This is a sales review: We came for the tour and the sales rep was insistent on receiving our social security numbers. At the casino we were told to just listen to the 120 min presentation and you will receive free gifts. I have been on timeshare tours before and was never forced to provide a SS #. The sales rep was very persistent even after we told her no, no, no from the minute we sat down. As a result we received our entire deposit back plus the ATM fee and 2 coupons to a restaurant at the Flamingo. The worst sales experience and waste of a day!!","10415":"Henry and Gustavo thank you so much for THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!! You guys were fast, efficient and got us the right part we needed with a smile!!! Thanks for the gloves too keep us clean doing this dirty job!! Thanks for going the extra mile! You're the best!!!","10416":"Really genius idea. I ordered at about 9pm and it was delivered a little before 10pm. I got Half Baked so I could try a few different cookies. All of the cookies tasted great, the ice cream was average so I'd skip that next time.","10417":"This is a great place if you are interested in glass work.  This includes stained glass, flamework (bead making), fusing (melting glass), and glass blowing.  Their fusing center is open whenever the store is open with lots of little projects available from about $5 to about $50.  They also have classes ranging in the $50 to $300 range.  I've taken the flamework bead making class...twice.  I've also done the blown glass ornaments class.  Fusing classes I've tried include the fused strips bowl (twice), fused jaws bowl (twice), and hanging air plant holder.  There are more I want to try too...when I can fit them into my schedule.\n\nThe staff is helpful, and super talented...stop in to see their work, available for purchase too.","10418":"We've passed here for several years and have always wanted to check it out.  They grill they chicken outdoors and you can smell the delicious smoke from blocks away. \n\nWe finally tried it today and we were very disappointed.  \n\nWe ordered the family meal.  Full chicken, rack of ribs, and three sides.   The chicken was dry.  The ribs were okay...tasted like they were boiled.   And the sides were mediocre.  The family meal was $50. \n\nThey have one flavor of BBQ sauce.  It tasted like regular KC Masterpiece.  They had one hit sauce, which tasted like Frank's Red Hot.  \n\nService was good.  Location was convenient.  Food was mediocre.  We won't be back.","10419":"I was a member for years but without a large household to supply, the warehouse store has lost its appeal.  The one thing that kept me going back was their deals on tires.\nYes, you can save a few percent on tires but here's the rub: service in the tire shop is terrible!  I'm certain it is part of their business model to under staff the tire shop so you have to wait for hours to get a tire rotation, leaving you with little alternative but to spend the time shopping in the warehouse.\nAnd waiting in line to save a few cents on gasoline is just stupid.\nI finally have had enough!\nGoodbye Costco membership!\nGood riddance!","10420":"This is one of our favorite Chinese restaurants  in town. Over the years I have probably had everything on the menu. The sizzling rice soup is the best I've had. I usually have one of the shrimp dishes, my favorite being the Kung Pao Shrimp.","10421":"So good. Yummy. You should definitely try it. Location is at the renovated linq hotel and wow!!  So impressed by the staff and venue vibe.","10422":"After many years of enjoying and recommending Kaya, I am reluctantly forced to downgrade it from 4.5 stars to  2.5. As uncharacteristic as it is for a Big Burrito Group establishment, I must sadly report that the  service and food quality have diminished to the point of  consistent disappointment.","10423":"I cam here with my cousins and really enjoyed myself. The ambiance is great, the restaurant is spacious, the service is great, and the food delivery was very quick. I got the gnocchi which was delicious and a perfect amount of food for one person! While the plates are meant to be shared, all of my cousins ordered the french onion soup, which they all said was really good!","10424":"I came in on a Saturday looking for rims and tires the counter guys helped me right away and answered all my questions and made helpful suggestions ordered the parts and brought it in the following Tuesday and they completed the job in one day I very satisfied with the results.","10425":"My wife and I come here often, but after today's experience, we might have to find another place for vietnamese food. The food is good and the prices are decent. However, the service here is a hit or miss, and lately it has been absolutely horrible. Our orders often come out incorrect or items are missed despite pointing to the item on the menu when ordering. At first, we thought it was because they are busy, but there weren't that many dinners tonight and this seems to be the norm based on our past few experiences here.","10426":"First of all I been a loyal Cora customer,  I been coming to them almost every other Sunday with my family \n\nWent here last Sunday. \n\nThe service overall was pretty bad.   Waitress was super rude and was rushing us to order.  Even though restaurant was not busy as I normally have seen them.   She had one other table beside ours.   We were so upset that we ask her not to serve us.  Completely ruin our time there. \n\nWe had ordered 3 dishes...  My dad's was the last to get his and there was a 10 minute time difference from the time I got mine and him getting his. The portions have shrunk,  barely got any home fries. \n\nWe won't be returning to this Coras again. And I will forward this to their head office.   They need to train their staff and do some quality control...  I hope this review turns off people from going here.","10427":"I work with a company that's uses Homeward bounds services., they are the most Amazing clinic I have been to. The cleanliness and attention to detail is incredible., if there was 10 stars they would get it..,","10428":"Amazing. White garlic sauce, feta, spinach, bacon, shrimp. Mother of God. Please help me.","10429":"Boyfriend had corned beef sandwich with potato salad. $13. I had corned beef hash with eggs and a bagel. $12. Ginormous cinnamon roll. $3. Hair boyfriend found in rye bread .... Free. \n\nAfter boyfriend found a long hair inside the bread I lost my appetite. He didn't let me say anything but it was so disgusting. Needless to say I was disappointed.","10430":"I only had 20 mins to grab dinner before I go to the comedy show, so Tokyo Express was close to M's house I run in.  Got my food in 10 min and inhaled my gyoza, terriyaki chicken, and my drink.  The sauce and chicken was ok.  It was a little warm inside the restaurant.","10431":"Very nice place to go.  Justin is great and greats you like an old friend he hasn't seen in a while, whether he k it's you or not.  Love their happy hour specials.   Food is good and they will do anything to make sure you leave satisfied.   Great place.  Outdoors is nice as well. Will definitely be back!","10432":"Ordered a burger with mexi poutine. The burger was cold and tasteless but was the highlight of the meal. The poutine looked like someone had vomited on the fries, and it didn't taste any better! I advise ppl to stay away from this place, horrible food and the worker there isn't very energetic or personable. Want a good poutine? Than go to Big Cheese!","10433":"Spring broke, called them out, made a quick appointment. Great work fixing it, and a good price. Happy with the service.","10434":"I've had good experience with the advisors thats have helped me and the services that were provided. Best oil service specials.","10435":"Some of the doctors will do a sales pitch with you and try to provoke fear inside of you to get your animals unnecessary treatment they don't need. You have to really know your shit yourself so you know to take their advice with a grain of salt and only stick to what you know your animal needs. There was a black doctor that took care of us and you could tell that he was lying and not comfortable with it.  I have done work in timeshare sales so I know all about trying to create fear and urgency and all that crap in people and he was trying to do it to me so it was quite amusing.  It's really sad that it's almost impossible to get honest people with integrity to advise you on medical help for yourself and your animal in this country but that's capitalism for you.","10436":"For all the Cirque shows in Vegas I've been to, this was probably my least favorite.  Now before you start throwing stuff at me yelling \"how could you\" here is my reasoning.\n\nIf you go into this show expecting a typical Cirque show, you aren't going to find it here.  Yes they have the usual tricks and stuff, but remember - this is a Beatles show more than a Cirque show.  It's more about the music, not the acrobatics.  The acrobatics is only there to complement the music.  So if you aren't a huge Beatles fan, pass on this one.","10437":"After devouring an excellent meal next door in under 11 minutes, my friends and I still weren't totally satisfied so we popped in this taco joint to check it out. We ordered a couple of tacos each and a couple of Mexican soft drinks to share. \n\nBeing born and partially raised in Mexico, I naturally asked for the salsas (in Spanish with a Chilango accent) when the lady brought our order. She nervously gave me an unbelievable response: \"we don't prepare our food too spicy here.\" I couldn't believe what I was hearing so I had to confirm:\" you don't have salsa here?\" \"We don't.\"\n\nI don't know if they really don't serve salsas or they ran out and had to use a lame excuse, but that and the fact that they put purple cabbage in their tacos, failed the test...go else where if you want Mexican tacos.","10438":"Best mocha I've ever had.  Frothy, silky, mmmmm.  Wonderful service and free wifi - lovely.","10439":"I'm a sushi purist.  Please no fusion crap.  Very few places can pull off fusion and I'm sorry but you're definitely not in the runnings. Serve me my fish off straight from the waters onto my rice.  Thank you sir, now get outta my way you're blocking my view of the fish I'm going to devour.\n\nHuge disappointment, pricey, trendy, and mostly empty and how dare you forget my soy sauce again?  Don't you serve sushi? Doesn't it say that in the name of your restaurant? Even after I pointed it out to one of the servers he jokingly said, \"yah and we're a sushi joint, you think we'd have soy sauce.\"\n\nGimme my freakin soy sauce!","10440":"I've been going to Crystal Nails for almost a year and I love this place.  Everyone there has worked on my nails at one point or another and it's always perfect.  I suggest making an appointment so you don't have to wait.  Thank you to all there for keeping my fingers and toes looking gorgeous!","10441":"Yum! Yum! Yum homemade soup!  Second visit and have tried the homemade soup both times.  Nothing like a good bowl of soup on some of these overcast cold days to warm the body and put a sparkle in the mind!  \n\nHad the tomato pepper jack soup.  So tasty creamy rich tomato with the sharp pepper jack.  Had the Reuben Gone Fishin'..fresh talapia with coleslaw, swiss and russian dressing...very good and a little sloppy.  Great combination.   \n\nMeet some friends and everyone tried one of the soups.  I think they had 4 available.  Everyone was pleased!   Also, BYOB and we did! Nice place to eat and visit with friends over a warm soup and glass of wine.","10442":"Probably the most decent place for macarons in Markham.  It's a small shop but the ambiance is aighhht for relaxation and conversation.  The Earl Grey and Lychee Rose are the BEST flavours there.  Everything from its size, flavour, colour, presentation, and even sandwich ratio was perfect (compared to other Markham shops).  The prices vary by flavour but each piece can run from $2.25-$2.50 (no tax on half dozen).  So if you can't afford to fly to Paris or New York or you're too lazy to drive down to Nadege, take my advice and visit Ruelo.  This place serves cakes, coffee, and high tea as well if you're craving something different. The coffee isn't the greatest but when you pair it with something as delectable as the pistachio macaron, you won't even notice.\n\nEDIT - Jun 14\/11 - I finally had the chance to try the Wasabi Grapefruit macaron.  They never seemed to have it when I go, but this time I was lucky enough to grab one.  I was skeptical at first about the combination of japanese mustard with the bitter grapefruit, but it works!  Definitely go try!","10443":"*this review is based on service experience,  not food. \n\nDear Morris Ramen,\n\nI came to you on the afternoon of 9\/8\/17 with a slip of paper that held my full name, card number, and expiration date. Knowing you do not take reservations, after speaking with the host, I explained and wrote down the 3 customers who would be coming in at 7pm and that I would like to pay for their first round of drinks. (Written on paper with bank and customer info given to host.)\n\nI arrive at 7pm with said guests. Table is sat, I order a round of sake. I am short on time and have to leave my guests before they are done eating. While still at the table, a server quickly drops off the slip of paper which I gave to the host earlier in the day with my card info on it. I ask the busied server \"is this taken care of?\" She says \"yes\".  \nLater I receive a text from my friend that she had to pay for the sake I promised to have earlier taken care of. My friend says to me \"they said they don't do that\". \n\nIt has been 30 minutes past with me calling your business number to discuss this matter and to offer my guests dessert as well as a fixed payment, and unfortunately, no answer. \n\nI am very dissatisfied with this. I stated clearly to the host with my name and phone number as well card info to apply to the check and to give me a call if there was any problems. I was later identified as this person and no action was taken. It was not only embarrassing but unprofessional.","10444":"I rated this a 1 star because the guy that served us was coughing which indicates the person is sick, or something else that he did. Anyways, I got sick with a flu-like symtomps after eating the food\n\nDisclaimer: There are other possibilities on why I am sick, but this is probably the reason why I got sick","10445":"I love coming to this location. The employees are always super energetic, keep customers entertained while waiting, & the manager Colleen is the nicest one. Plus the good is bomb!!!","10446":"On the one hand, i love gp and on the other, it's gotten obscenely expensive.  there are affordable shoes, but they are mostly canvas runners and the treton wellies. i only buy things there if they're on sale now. occasionally there's a find (notably chie miharas and marc jacobs under $100). but if they're going higher end, i'd like to see a bit more effort with the hig-end stuff. why are there no viv westwoods? and when did they shift from the quirky campers to the boring ones my mom picks up and tells me are \"nice\"?","10447":"It's a really nice spot in Cave creek if you like Coffee, wine or good craft beer on tap. Make sure to stop in to this little gem.","10448":"I come to this salon often for gel mani, pedi, eyebrows but I try to book with Heather. She is the only one who I will let do my eyebrows and sculpt tips because she does them even lol. I've had a pedi and gel mani with a few of the other ladies and they can be rude and file your nails uneven. I just call ahead and ask for Heather she's the best! She does hand and foot massage for pedicures. They do have matching gel and regular polish. This salon is clean unlike others in the area. There are nice pedi chairs and bowls. Prices are pretty good.","10449":"I have my High Speed Internet service though Primus Canada \"bell dry loop\" I originally went with Primus because they were one of the few companies that offered unlimited high speed Internet with no download cap.\n\nWell guess what! Not anymore, now they only offer 25Gigs cap,  modem rental  for about $48 a month.  \n\nCostumer service could also use some improvements \"LIKE GETTING PEOPLE THAT SPEAK ENGLISH TO ANSWER THE PHONES\" yes customer service in Canada should be in clearly spoken English.","10450":"Meh.\n\nI stopped in here to enjoy some sweets and drinks for someones 30th birthday.\nTruth. The drinks are very tasty! As are the desserts. I was actually surprised at how big mine was! Location is nice too\n\nWould I make it a point to go back? Nope. Not at all. Here's why...\nI understand this is Vegas, and DJ club music is all around, but why do I have to hear it at almost deafening levels in the dining room? Additionally, it's fairly dark in there too. I guess that adds to the, 'ambiance.' \n\nService was very slow. Not to mention the server didn't look like he enjoyed his job. He was not friendly, didn't stop by much, and just didn't seem to care. It's not like the place was even full. The desserts and drinks were slow to come out as well. It was an hour and a half ordeal to order and receive two drinks, two desserts, and pay.\n\nThe upcharges. What? I have to pay for water? We're in the middle of the desert, in summer, and I have to pay you 2$ for water? (which im fairly certain is tap water) Per person. F that. If it wasn't for the Birthday (and the fact I had a red-eye flight 3 hours later), I would have ditched.\n\nIf you want to stop here to check the place out. Ok, sure. I wouldn't waste my money here again though. It's better spent elsewhere.","10451":"Tow truck is a dick and will tow your car if you are a resident and if you have family over be careful you might have to pay 250 to get it out of the pound. The hallways are always dirty and the kids living there are extremely loud even on weekdays. The pool area can be pretty loud. The music is always playing loudly. The staff up front are disorganized and a couple of them are rude. The printer in the computer lab was constantly not working for the whole year. Don't lock your bike up outside my wheel got stolen. Very unsafe area with bums lingering around. I would not recommend living here. Although for the Tempe area it is good location wise, and the gym is pretty awesome other than that I would invest in living in north Scottsdale or an apartment elsewhere.\nFormer resident May 2015- July 2016","10452":"If you don't have the time or the means to make it out to a campfire this summer, I HIGHLY suggest you schedule a visit to Hollywood Gelato for the Roasted Marshmallow gelato...instant summer on a spoon! I also tried Coconut Cream Pie, Tahitian Vanilla, Valrhona Chocolate, Sicilian Pistachio and Key Lime Pie, as well as the Wild Forest Berries sorbet. All flavors were scrumptious, although I was more than a little dismayed by the lack of lemon meringue flavor, the picture of which was what first tempted me to visit this place ;-p \n\nThis place isn't cheap but it's worth treating yourself.  I could have easily eaten a large size serving but don't interpret that as meaning HG is stingy!  I simply prefer having dessert as the main course, especialy when it's this good.  \n\nThis place was bustling at 7 pm on a Tuesday night - there is no way I'd attempt a trip on the weekend - I can only imagine how crazily busy it must get.  Interestingly enough - The Mad Italian Gelato Bar across the street was nearly empty...is it just too new or is HG a superior product?  Only a taste-test will determine the truth.  To be continued...","10453":"I went to this place today and i had the chicken burger cuban revolution it was very good but they dont have filtered water and the bun was stale but it was very tasty","10454":"I really enjoy the atmosphere at this barber shop and it's really close to my residence. The fact that they hand out suckers to kids to keep them quiet is a plus :-) Finally, it's also very racially diverse. Which is great if you're a single woman and need to step outside of your box :-)","10455":"For food court noodles, this place is a tad more expensive than Chinatown restaurants! However the noodles and soup are delicious and totally worth the trek to this gloomy food court!\n\nService is fast and extremely friendly. They take AMEX!!!! The chef will make your noodles right after you order! Woot woot!! The beef is very tender and extremely flavourful. The braised pork #11 soup is very very very delicious!!! But fatty. I will return!!!!\n\nThis is Chinese food. If Japanese ramen is what you're looking for, go to Kazu!","10456":"Love Dr. Jaki and her staff.  She's very thorough with her exams.  I've been a patient of hers for quite some time now and I always come out satisfied because she's helping me to SEE!  She also had nice frames too!  I would highly suggest going to her.","10457":"To once be a king is delightful but to be a queen? Burgers don't come with fries, nor any side of that matter. Kings demand a side to wash down such amounts of beef but this establishment foes not confide in those demands.","10458":"Kinda average. The best italian is Il Piazziolo.","10459":"I love the coffee & food at this place and often stop in when I fly. But I just had an experience with the rudest person behind the counter that I just turned around and left. I was really shocked at how sarcastic & dismissive he was. I simply asked what was in one of the food items and since he was turned away from me I couldn't hear him properly. When I questioned him, he just became sarcastic and rude. It was so unexpected and weird that I was taken aback. I wasn't being nasty--I was just asking a question. This place has the best and most interesting food in the airport but I don't want my panini served with a side of snottiness. I'm sure I'll stop in again but not if that guy is there.","10460":"This restaurant is (almost)  literally a whole in the wall! I live very close and walked by without even noticing the restaurant. The awning sign out front did not entice me to give a second look. I was brought by a friend and was shocked when I walked inside. It's a really stylish, cool space. The people working there are young and very friendly. The food is cooked to order and so good. I got the Bim Bim Bab (Bop?). I have been back since and love this place. Their prices are reasonable, but eating in is a challenge - it's tiny. If you're in the neighbourhood, check it out - and if you're not, it's worth the trip.","10461":"In the 8 years I have owned my mountain bike, I have had to take it to at least 5 different shops because each one has closed or merged with another store. When I last went to go visit Adventure, I was literally mortified that they had closed but saw a sign on the door stating they had moved to Action.\nHowever, upon my initial visit, I was not impressed. I came in to buy a spare tube and it literally took me a long time to find someone to help me.  Additionally, when I got to the repair counter to ask for a quote on a tuneup, the technician was on the phone and did not acknowledge me (Not even, \"I'll be right with you).\n\nAfter this experience, I will not be back.","10462":"Great atmosphere. The guy moved a little too fast making my sandwich. He talked so fast I had no idea what he asked me lol. He may have worked at Jimmy Johns freaky fast subs in his past life Lolol. But it was really clean and nice.","10463":"Excellent food, service, and you must try the Blackberry Bourbon Lemonade!  Best chicken I've ever had.","10464":"Finally checked this place out after passing it on the street umpteen times and was quite pleased. \n\nNice comfortable decor, comfy upscale seats (for a burger place) and really friendly staff. \n\nThe menu has pretty standard burger and sandwich offerings, with a plethora of additional toppings available (some at a cost). I really liked this place, and wish they'd expand their dinner offerings beyond burgerdom. Would definitely be back more frequently in such a case.","10465":"Noodle Asia had pretty fast service and decent food, though we found it slightly odd that my husband's noodle dish with seafood came out several minutes before the vegetable fried rice.\n\nThe location is either great or horrible, depending on his you look at it, since it's partially open to The Venetian's casino floor. So if you want a quick bite while still having a view to the action, it's great. If you wanted a quiet, more intimate meal, you really should go elsewhere.","10466":"Ah, RuSan's. There's four in ATL, and our little outpost here. CLT veggies should rejoice, and I come here when I want (a lot of) sushi, because the selection is large and in charge. There is no where else in our fair town where you sit down and actually have to think about what rolls to order - the selection of veg-friendly stuffs is that comprehensive, and they're all about creating custom rolls. Don't get me wrong, I love avocado\/cuke rolls, but one does crave deviation, occasionally.\n\nApart from that, I've had the Yasai soba (my fiance's angry tummy can attest to the broth being fish-based, as tradition dictates), edamame, fried rice (very good, but hey, it's fried rice), a few other hot items. But it's all about the vegetable tempura roll (special order) or what I like to call the bagel - tomato, cream cheese, scallion, toasted sesame seeds, deep fried (another special order). Yeehaw.","10467":"I had a coupon for this place and thought I'd give it a try on a recent lunch break from work. When I walked in, it was as another reviewer mentioned, filled with odd trinkets and little girl dresses for sale, which I found strange but not a turn off. And as a yet another reviewer shared, the woman who was at the front only asked me how many (it was just me), grabbed a menu and didn't utter another word as she walked me to my table. If that's their first impression, they need to improve it ASAP. She was not friendly whatsoever. No smile, no \"how are you today?\", zilch, zip, nada. Fortunately, the server was friendlier. I ordered a pink lemonade and looked over the menu. I inquired about the Lemon Herb Chicken to make sure it wasn't breaded (the whole GF thing), and he assured me it was not. It came with a side so I chose the mashed potatoes. The meal came in a reasonable time. The chicken was lukewarm and not hot, like it had been sitting under a warmer or something. It didn't taste bad, just not freshly made. And it was served with a lemon slice on top, but the chicken itself did not taste lemony, only herby. The mashed potatoes were made from red potatoes and while not bad, had a ton of green stuff in it, parsley maybe, too much IMO. My overall experience is what prompts the two star rating. The lady at the front should be warm and welcoming. The meal should taste fresh and not pre-made and maybe cut back a bit on the parsley, or whatever, in the mashed potatoes. I will likely not return.","10468":"The food is absolutely delicious!!  I am very happy I tried this place. Great service and decent portions, leftovers for sure!","10469":"Great self storage solution! The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and billing options are simple. Would recommend this self storage complex along with just in time moving company.","10470":"The food is always delicious and fresh. Service is great! A really wonderful place.  And good dessert if you have room. Tonight we had burgers which were outstanding. The fries are really good and the onion rings outstanding! Last time steak sliders which were so good!","10471":"Met up with a friend for lunch. I had the tuna wrap. Light and refreshing. On the recommendation of Yelpers my bf had the  steak kabobs- he thought they were fantastic and hopes to recreate them at home. I may have stolen a piece of steak or three. Service was friendly, steady stream of  customers. Will return.","10472":"Food was amazing service was great best thing about this place is that the people here know your name what is a big plus cause this place is packed with repeat regulars !! The food was not over loaded with grease or chili Thank you to our server Israel for making  my first trip here the best I will be back an I'm bringing friends to try out your bar !!!! ;)","10473":"I recently visited The Deuce Lounge at Aria and I did not have a pleasant experience with the bartender.  I stayed at Aria for the weekend and all the employees are nice and helpful; however, when I went into the Deuce Lounge, the bartender who helped was rude in his respect. \nWe ordered our Carrot Cake martinis, and we wanted to each pay our own bill, so he gave us a number of 22 each, but the drink itself was suppose to be 18 dollars.  Some paid with credit card and some paid with cash. \n\nI gave him 25 cash, and I was waiting for my change.  At the same time, I looked at my friend's bill who used her credit card, there was an \"automatic\" gratuity charge of $3.00 dollars added to the bill!!!  I don't know there was this charge when we had a party of 3. \nOkay, maybe there is, so as I was waiting for my $3 dollar change, I did not get anything for 3 minutes, so I asked the bartender, and he was like, I am getting it..... And he came back right away, and tossed it on the table like he was pissed... \nI was unhappy with this service, because that was just wrong to try and keep the change when I did not voluntarily give it to him. In addition the added $3 gratuity!!! \n\nThis was a very unpleasant visit in the Deuce Lounge and I expected a more laid back professional experience inside the Aria.","10474":"I love this place!  Great food...my sister and I split a cajun burger which was delish!  Drink prices are good too.  The servers were great and it even had a decent pool table.  This is my favorite bar for UFC and Wranglers hockey.","10475":"Mmmmm, potstickers, buns, dumplings, meat pies.  I can't get enough.  And less than 1 mile from my house!  Where have you been all my life Chou? \nAnd my favorite was the eggplant stirfry with potatoes and jalapenos.  Wow!  \nThe service is great, the 2 women that took our order and brought the food were nice and funny.   Where else can you get a waitress that tells my 5 year old that he needs to drink water instead of juice because juice will make him \"fluffy\"  (how sweet and PC) and his belly will get big?  Or how about when the other lady asked me if I had been to China, and when I indicated I hadn't she told me \"you don't need to go, you come here\".  \nSo good food with a side of comedy.  My new favorite restaurant.","10476":"I've been training in gyms for 25 years, and the coaches at Alpha by Lifetime Fitness are the best in the business. The gym itself is the envy of the crossfit community, with tons of equipment and a huge rig. Get personal training everyday for he cost of a couple of individual sessions. The members are welcoming and friendly, and unlimited yoga, Barre, etc. are included in your membership!","10477":"Had a quick meal here on our last day in town, before our flight. It was quite a walk through the hotel\/casino to get to the restaurant, but once you get there you can't really miss it. I still can visualize it clearly--- an obnoxious, bright orange rose-patterned wall that made my head spin not only because I was hungover but really because it made a pretty \"loud\" statement.\nDecor is nice and modern, and it is a pretty casual restaurant. No dress code---(I've been there, walking from restaurant to restaurant because each kept rejecting the guys' outfits) so you don't have to worry about being underdressed. DO dress casual, DON'T dress up.\nCasual does not mean they're not professional! They provide good service. To be entirely honest, when we were there our server was busy tending to her larger parties. While I acknowledge that yes, larger parties do require more attention, we felt like we did not get as good as a service from her than the other table. However, the bussers and food runners did make sure we were taken care of, so the experience was  good nevertheless.\nSince it was a light lunch, we got three things but it was more than enough. The wings and the skewers were amazing, I would definitely go back to get them again. We also got the salmon entree, but that one was just okay. It was good, but noting memorable.","10478":"Took my daughter and husband to go watch star wars not only were our assigned seats taken and we had to ask them to move but the concession stand moved slower than a snail on a mission. They were to busy flirting and gossiping to even notice the line starting to back up what a shame","10479":"The food tastes good, but over the 20 times I've been here, the service is lacking and I've seen cleaner bathrooms at coachella.","10480":"Plenty of parking here. They don't take reservations, and due to it's popularity expect a wait time to be seated. Definitely a place if you're looking for affordable sushi. I favor the Crab, Tiger, and Haru Popper rolls.","10481":"I work in the office park where this place is located. I will eat there only out of desperation. In fact, this past Friday, I was short on time and skipped lunch rather than going there. Their food is mediocre at best. I think it changed hands in the Spring of 2008 and since then, portions are smaller, prices are higher, and I think the woman who appears to be the owner is irritating.   They charge you to pay with a debit\/credit card. Also, their ventilation is not good, so you will leave there smelling like fried food.\n\nThe old owners were very nice people and very fair. My only complaint with them was that the coffee was Douwe Egberts and was terrible.","10482":"This car rental company out of Mccarran Airport in Las Vegas NV is a RIP OFF!!!  They purposely leave out pertinent information when you book online!  I called the day of pick up to let them know to push back my pick up time & this is when I learned that I had to have an out of state license to utilize the reservation I had already made!  Apparently the reservation was for in town use!  Who does that? Who rents a care for in town use if you own a perfectly functioning vehicle?  Why would I make a reservation as such?  Now I am fighting for a refund as they charged me right on the spot for the reservation weeks back from my actual pick up date! The website is a sham as non of this was indicated on my confirmation page!!!  Dont rent your cars from this place people not unless you enjoy being scammed & RIPPED OFF!!! :-\/","10483":"The selection of stores is okay. I came here mainly for the Nike factory outlet. I came out with a Vegas Knights license plate frame from a small hockey shop.\n\nInside the food court, there was an Easter Bunny that your kids could take pictures with. Unfortunately it did not have any specific hours or days that he was there but I was there on a Thursday.","10484":"Pretty decent and fast. The chow mein is unique, but a must-try at least once. Live a little!","10485":"Food was excellent and on point! Nihari and naans are by far the best! I honestly felt like I was back home, eating authentic pakistani food. The owner is super nice and gave us some great recommendations or things to do and see. I highly recommend it!","10486":"I'm from oc california.  Can't compare but this place is good enough.  The best part is they have red pepper flake chili oil.","10487":"Having been to many other tgifridays I can say this was the worst I've seen.  Service was subpar.  Having to ask three times for silverware is not acceptable.  Food took forever and came cold.  The portions were definitely smaller than other locations.  Prices way too high for poor quality.  Bathrooms filthy.  There are much better choices in the area.","10488":"I'm a regular at the Ajax location as it's close to home and I love the food there. Tried the seekh kabobs at the Scarborough location today and had to return them as they were completely dry. Got a takeout of the same order as I was running late only to realize later they were still pretty dry. Guys you need to add fat to ground meat before you cook it else the kabobs will be dry no matter how you cook them. Get your act together before you start losing customers and shut down forever.","10489":"Delicious and good for a dessert, late night snack after a show or just to cure that craving.  Service is pretty fast, but our line was short.  Prices are as expected for Vegas Strip Casino.  They serve them piping hot so beware of the skin on the roof of your mouth.","10490":"This place is amazing!!! Service is always friendly!! I always have the spicy fried chicken and it is to die for! The spice is more of a background flavour, their fries are some of the best I've had, their chicken is always succulent, their macaroni salad is bomb, and their prices are damn good for the quality of food your getting! Honestly one of my favorite places to eat!","10491":"I used to stop in over a year ago after the ballet or symphony and found it a pleasant experience. Since moving back, I tried it several times again and found the experience pretty bad. I like the atmosphere but the service was terrible both times. Will try again someday in the distant future  when hopefully things will improve again. There are far more better places in downtown Pittsburgh that seem to appreciate their customers. I can excuse most things but not unnecessary rudeness.","10492":"One of my favorites place that's close to my house. Added bonus that kids meal is only $6!!! I mean $6, wow!! And my kids stick to the kids menu since the food is amazing. I love the wine selection too.","10493":"We had a group of 20 and it was easily accommodated. We were split into two tables but right next to each other. Our host took care of our seating and meal arrangements. EVERYTHING was sooooo good! I had a pleasant experience at this restaurant. It's located inside of the Venetian. WAGYU on everything! Lol! It was soo tasteful and the texture was like no other. \n\nLet's just say, the more you gamble, the more you get comped.","10494":"Swan is one of the major players on the Toronto brunch scene.  I finally had the chance to come here this past weekend.  We approached the restaurant a few minutes before they opened and they had diners eagerly waiting to come in, a great sign.  The diners decor is so dated but it works in a queen st west hipster way.  The breakfast plate is a great way to gauge any restaurant, and Swans is a little different than most.  First off they don't offer bacon, they offer pancetta, and weirdly capicolla.  I chose the smoked trout with a $3 supplement, but it was well worth it.  The fish was delicately smoked, and it was firm, but not tough.  The eggs and toast were standard, the addition of the broiled tomato was unexpected, and quite charred and smokey.  The potatoes are my favourite part and if they arent good, the whole experience is tainted.  The potatoes were reminiscent of a salt lick.  My sis also had potatoes with hers and she complained to our waitress about them, so she went to the kitchen and asked if they could do anything about it.  She returned with an excuse that all of the potatoes are made the same way and if they gave us any replacements that they would have the same level of saltiness.  This was slightly baffling considering we were the first guests, so how could all of the potatoes be prepared already?  Anyways, she suggested a side salad which was appreciated.  Another waitress first brought the salad to the table beside us, and than realized her error and put it on our table without a word.  I appreciate the solution however if felt very disingenuous.  \n\nOverall, Swan has a hip vibe to it but with the poor service and issues with our food, i doubt that i will return.","10495":"Super sweet service, big space and not that many tables. Comfy booths and cafeteria type set up. \n\nThe pictures on the menu boards make you salivate before you have a change to order!\n\nDinner under $8? HELL YEA \n\nGot the veggie burger loaded with the free toppings ^_^ \n\nTheir home made hot sauce was bomb. Burger had a weird texture so I couldn't tell what the ingredients were but good. The bun was light and delicious as well. \n\nMy friend asked for no bun and they made it a great salad. \n\nWill be back for their fries!","10496":"Fantastic food. Their enchiladas are one of the best I've had. The service was pretty fast. Good portion size. All the ingredients tasted fresh and well cooked. BYOB but they have corkage. I would definitely visit again and recommend la palapa to anyone looking for Good Mexican food.","10497":"Due to the horrible service from the \"Service Manager\" Meghan, I will never return to this location. My family and I have many great experience at this location including friendly service and great food. This time the food was not too great. My mom and dad ordered ribs that came out burnt and very dry. Of course they ate a couple ribs before making a complaint, which we hardly ever do. After I kindly asked the server to bring over her manager so we can address the issue to her, the service manager meghan came and agreed that the ribs were burnt and should have never made it out of the kitchen. She did not offer a replacement meal, instead took the meal and said she will take care of it. When we received our check, I noticed that a partial discount of $6.00 was taken off of the bill. I kindly requested the server to bring her manager back so we can address this problem again. Meghan comes back with an attitude and decided to argue with me about the food. She insisted that there was only a partial discount because my mom and dad ate a couple of ribs. I tell her that sure some of the food had been consumed but over half had to be thrown out and the total inconvenience should have been enough to take that meal off the tab. She decided to interrupt and give me a lecture on how the food should have not been consumed? I told her I don't have a problem with the $6 discount so long as she would have offered a replacement meal! She was very unprofessional, very rude, with a nasty attitude. She failed her job as a \"service manager\" and ultimately made matters worse. Her horrible \"guest service\" was an experience that I never had before, and because of this I will refrain from coming to this location. I'm disappointed it had to come down to this because usually the service and food is great. \nThanks a lot Meghan. \n\nSincerely a family who was looking for a nice meal to eat.","10498":"We had steak and shrimp fajitas for two.  The shrimp was large and flavorful, the steak was tender and tasty.  Their were grilled onions and red and green bell peppers mixed in with the fajitas.  The server brought the fajitas to the table in this large cast iron pot and set them on fire at our table!  \n\nThe servers were very attentive and by checking in at Yelp, we got a 15% discount off of our bill!  Our sever gave us a free flan just because I mentioned it was my first time there!\n\nAll in all, we had an enjoyable evening and we will definitely go back again!","10499":"Today I had excellent service from the guys at Jiffy Lube! The assistant manager Michael answered the phone right away and was able to tell me that they had the battery I needed for my car in stock. My old battery was corroded and he cleaned off the area and sprayed it with a protectant to help my new battery from having problems! We were in and out within 20 minutes and I was beyond relieved since it was close to closing time! I would highly recommend their friendly service!","10500":"My calamari was so so. My issue is with the professionalism of the staff.  When my change was brought to me the waitress said it is a dollar short because they ran out of change. She didn't say \"when I get the change I will bring it to you\", or \"do you have a dollar and I will trade you a five?\" She took it upon herself to keep it. I was busy talking to friends so until I counted my change did we understand what she was telling us.  My friend said,\"did I just hear what I thought I heard\"?\n\nThe money is not the issue, it is the way it was handled and the attitude of matter of fact.\n\nThis had nothing to do with a tip since they already had added 20%. Truthfully I usually give 25%.","10501":"Our salesperson \"Mo\" was great to work with.  Made the buying process very easy and stress free.  He was very patient as we considered 3 or 4 different models.  Elie the Sales Manager made sure we got a great deal.  Their passion for great customer service was exceptional!  Thanks guys!","10502":"I brought my wedding gown to see if anything can be done as it was damaged by previous cleaners. It was a beautiful silk that has been washed and Elite Cleaners attempted to restore it. They pressed it and packaged so beautifully  Unfortunately, I had  to buy a new as they told me they did all they could but the damage was un-reverseable.  Staff is professional and sincerely care about what they do. Ladies, bring your gown here! I highly recommend this place! With my wedding less then a month away, I will bring my gown here for sure. I wouldn't trust anyone else.","10503":"We moved here from Oregon and had not been able to find a Chinese restaurant that we liked until trying Capital Seafood.  My hubby and I shared 3 different dishes and the flavors absolutely exploded in our mouths.  We couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  We had Yang Chow Fried Rice (best we've ever had), the Fried Squid and a Chow mien dish.  And we had enough left over for two full lunches.  Unbelievable!  We're going back tonight.  We want to try new dishes but don't want to miss out on the ones we already had, so we'll flip a coin.   Flavor, flavor, flavor.  And reasonably priced.","10504":"I stopped in with my daughter around 10:30 am on Thursday. They were busy. But it was not but a few minutes wait for a table. Friendly servers... Always smiling. Very efficient but of course the best part is the food! Portions overly generous. Tasty! I got the Bacon Scramble that was on special. It was excellent. Just the right amount of fresh delicious ingredients. I could not better myself at home. It was priced at $8.99 and well worth it with choices of potatoes and a bread or pancake. I got the biscuit and hashbrowns. Yum. My daughter had the two egg deal that came with a waffle . Would recommend this place to anyone for good down home cooking and great service. I've been to two locations. Both consistently GOOD!","10505":"So we just went to the new bakery at 1847.. WOW what a disappointment. $17 for 2 ham and cheese croissants and 2 tarts. One tiny slice of ham and half a slice of cheese..no condiments of any kind. The tart has barely any filling. Selection was poor. Won't be returning. Highly recommend not to bother trying it.","10506":"This is a gem of a coffee shop. It has that hard to find mix of excellent coffee paired with a comfortable space where you can either linger with friends or work on your laptop. The owner is a kind but no-nonsense guy who makes sure you like what he's served you before he gets you to pay.\n\nThe coffee itself is Australian-style, so you can get your long black, short black, flat white, and so on here. The owner-barista knows what he's doing here, so the drinks are done well.\n\nWhat really puts this place over the top is the space itself. As you enter, it is immediately welcoming, especially because of the sign welcoming all races, genders, and identities. Inside, it feels like the library in your uncle's cozy country residence (if he had such a thing), but transported into downtown Toronto. There are newspapers and books strewn about the mix of tables, photos and paintings adorning the walls, and even a wall of diplomas from a variety of global universities. Most of the tables have outlets nearby, and the owner has placed handy adapter cables around the place so you can charge your phone. Also, as a side note, the ingeniously designed toilet\/bathroom sink is worth a look.\n\nThis is a place definitely worth seeking out if you want a break from all the coffee chains that populate Toronto's downtown core.","10507":"Love when airports have a USO!  This is a nice one with a cool vibe.  Couple downfalls are no toilets inside the USO and no sleep\/nap rooms, which are always my favorite.   There is WiFi and plenty of comfy sitting space with lots of outlets to charge up your devices before your flights.  The woman working when I was there was super nice and helpful.","10508":"Amidst the sea of highly acclaimed restaurants on the Vegas strip, this casual place is still a must for me with every visit to Vegas despite its average Yelp rating. In between all the fine dining, it's nice being able to escape from the Vegas bustle by not having to leave the Strip and cozy up to simple nostalgic home dishes.\n\nSzechwan beef soup is a traditional favorite of mine with the broth having the right amount of spice flavor and heat. The beef is tender and the noodles are on point being chewy and soft. \n\nThe fish filet congee is another comfort food. The fish is delicate and congee is cooked well. Personally, I wish there was more fish and this requires a couple dashes of salt, but after doing so at the table, it is perfect.\n\nUnlike typical Chinese restaurants, traditional Chinese cooking at home doesn't drown the dish with oils, sauce, and salt which is why Noodle Asia brings such comfort to me.","10509":"just average -- thai food should really zing .... lots of flavourful ingredients mean that it should have depth and freshness.  This place is far too tame, too sweet and not great.  Pad Thai - the signature dish of every thai restaurant - should be their best thing.  Here the noodles are too sticky and over done, there is the sweetness of peanut butter in there, and only a few shrimp.  \n\nPortion sizes are too small for the price and the service is middling.\n\nI wouldn't go again","10510":"Found this place thanks to yelp when I had s conference at a local hotel. I didn't want hotel food so made the short drive to the food truck randomly parked at a gas station. Two tacos, rice and beans later, I was in heaven and for under $10. Such a great find.","10511":"Been here dozens of times. The people working are very friendly if you get to talking to them. The pho itself is great. Broth is some of the best I have had, meat is cooked well (not the most meat you get but it's enough) and the pricing for the pho is very good. 9$ for large is a massive bowl, sure to fill you up. The other entrees are good, but the pricing on those is a little more (12-18$). Overall, the quality of the food, pricing, and atmosphere is one of my favorite places in the area. I prefer this pho's broth over 'superior pho' next door. The selection for entrees excluding pho is somewhat lacking compared to other places I have gone holds me back from giving this 5 stars, but it is still a fantastic place.","10512":"Food's good but the waiters are way too laid back and even impolite at times.\n\nOne waiter is looking insistently at my girlfriend. Not that I am jealous or that I lack confidence but they shall know when to behave like they are in a bar and when to behave like they are at work. I went twice there and the same waiter was intensively checking out female customers every time.\n\nThe other waiter wouldn't take my order properly as he was standing very far from me when taking notes (like I was apparently supposed to shout at him to say what I wanted). He did dare arguing with me that I shall have said something as soon as I noticed that he wasn't proposing me the proper sauces accompanying my meal...\n\nIt's the french school of waiting, where being impolite is accepted. The difference is that, in France, tipping 15% of the bill is not the norm. I'm waiting for much more coming from a supposedly chic establishment (at last when one looks at the prices).\n\nMontreal does not lack of good restaurants with servers providing great service. I'm definitely not going back to Lemeac before a long time.","10513":"I am currently here, at Applebee's writing this. First off, I must say our server Yuri is fantastic. However, the chef here needs to find another job, not around food. 3 of us ordered the 2 for $11 Vidalia onion steak combo... two with linguine and one with the Margarita chicken. 1 steak rare, one medium rare, one well done. And a children's steak, well done with applesauce. \n\nThe well done steak was cooked perfectly.\nThe rare steak was cook a little more than expected.\nThe medium rare steak was \"blue rare\"... inedible. \nThe children's steak was raaaaaare... and came out 5 minutes after the rest of our food.\n\nSent back the children's and the medium rare.\nChildren's came back medium, at best.\nMedium rare came out, a brand new steak, more rare than the first time. It's like they never even cooked it. Sent back a 2nd time.\n\nCalled the manager over, took my entree and my son's entree, the issue dishes, off the bill completely. Everyone was quite apologetic. Our server was OVER apologetic,  it was saccharine. \n\nFinally, the 3rd time that they brought out my steak, it was charred on the outside.  At least it was cooked on the inside. \n\nAll in all, not a horrible experience, but not as pleasant as past restaurant experiences.","10514":"The service was better today compared to my last experience. I ordered a chai tea & kadahi paneer with naan\/rice. It was really tasty and not too spicy at all. \n\nThe wait for food was reasonable and the check out part was a breeze. \n\n3 stars today & willing to bump it up on my next visit assuming the service is consistent.","10515":"Came here hearing that this place was finally a good Korean Restaurant around Pittsburgh! \n\nI ordered the kimchijiggae and it was really a taste of home, not quite, but better than what I can ask for at other places in terms of \"koreanness\".\nI've seen other reviews on this place and I have to agree on one thing. The price of the BBQ is low, and the price of other things are high. For example, Korean BBQ\/bulgogi is about $21\/$19 respectively. The kimchijiggae and bibimbap are around $13 or $15. \n\nA bit sad when I didn't get a bunch of side dishes (banchan) that you get at \"real\" Korean restaurants (you get only 3 with your meal) but the food was overall good. Tried my friends bibimbap and it tasted like it should, which is very good in Pittsburgh. No offense.","10516":"I just love Ladybug. The service is always friendly and fast. The place is very clean. The food is yummy. I had the \"Charlie Brown\" and the Cheesy Potato Soup. Very fresh. I love that they put cucumbers on that particular sandwich. What I like is that they will deliver just one sandwich with no minimum. The prices very reasonable.","10517":"As of right now....1 star and that's only because I had originally made an appointment for last Thursday (6\/1) for 1p, and had to call just to find out that the appointment had been forgotten. Called today and left a VM. Hopefully this business can rectify the actions from last week and I will be more than happy to change my review. Here starts the waiting game. (Got a Groupon, too late to cancel and I don't want the credits. This has to work out).\n\n\n*Follow up (6\/6): \nRamsey just returned my call. Rescheduled for tomorrow Wed 6\/7 for 11-1130a. Thank you sir!","10518":"I've been going to the Tropicana Cinemas for about 7 years.  It has closed, and reopened at least twice since then.  \nThis time around, it's doing pretty well.  The price to see a movie is only $1.50, and $1.00 on Tuesdays.  The movies that play here start playing a few weeks after they play at major movie theaters, but I don't really mind the wait most of the time.  The savings totally make up for it, even when I have to drive across town.\nMy gripes?  Well, with the ticket prices so low, a lot of people choose to bring their kids, and they tend to get VERY loud.  Sometimes the theaters aren't that clean, but they're usually okay.  You really can't complain too much when you only pay a buck.\nThe theater used to play old classic movies (Labyrinth, Jaws, and Dark Crystal to name a few), and we always made it a point to go see those.  It was seriously one of my favorite things to do.  For some reason, they chose to stop playing them.  :(","10519":"I like this mall because it's less crowded than Fashion. I bought a hoverboard from a kiosk at PV Mall. I got a good deal and decided to go with the extended warranty. So far so good! If you are looking for hoverboards, go here and ask for Jack. He knew everything about it and was super helpful!","10520":"The pizza was good and I see why others like it. I myself did no tlike the flavor. The cheese they used seem to have almost a smokey flavor ? I can't quite put my finger on it but I won't be ordering from here again even though I'm sure others love it. Best of luck","10521":"Amazing food... The presentation, quality, taste and portion size are perfect.  Comfortable, easy going atmosphere with fabulous staff.  We have gone several times including the last two new years where they kindly accomodated our vegetarian diet.","10522":"We accidentally found this place when STK couldn't fit us in for a late dinner in July.  We were impressed from start to finish!  Our server was wonderful and he walked us around the entire place, explaining all the different seafood to us along the way.  This place is cool because all the seafood is displayed around the room on ice (sort of like a very, very nice fish market) and you get to pick what you want.  We were instantly sold on the \"Scorpino\" when the server told us that it's a fish that feeds on crustacians and shellfish...HAD to be delicious...and it was!   We shared him and a small rock lobster as well as a few side dishes.  The food was to-die-for and the service matched.  This is probably our favorite Vegas restaurant and we've been to lots!  Warning:  we paid zero attention to prices and ended up with a $400 price tag before the tip, so this isn't a budget restaurant.  However, I'll admit we might have gone a little overboard on ordering.  :)  \n\nGo here for sure!","10523":"I called Homeowners Financial Group to do a simple refinance and now that it's finished I feel like I am in a worse position than when I started.  Initially the loan officer was very nice and worked with me on all options. After I agreed to go ahead is when I started feeling like I made a mistake. It seemed as if the loan officer was on her own and didn't find things out till the last minute.  First it was the appraisal that needed to be done yesterday.  After the appraisal I was informed on a Friday that I needed to complete a very minor repair by Monday morning which resulted in me cancelling plans I had made out of town. The appraiser showed up and snapped one picture. A week later I get another $200 charge on my credit card from him which brought the total appraisal fee to $700. For as trivial as the repair was it makes me think that this might be a common practice to gouge the customer. Maybe the appraiser is related to someone at Homeowners? I don't know?  \n\nWhen it came time to close there was no information on who was going to service my loan. I had a month before my payment was due and I was never contacted by phone or by mail. Finally I called them to ask if they would like my money and where should I send it, they did not know.  During this whole time I received letter after letter from multiple \"bi-weekly payment program\" companies they must have sold my information to. I gave it another couple days and called them back and asked again. They said a company called RCS would be servicing my loan and to send a check. First off it is 2015 and I don't have any checks because I haven't written one in 5 years. Second, even if I had a check it would not be there by the due date. I then tried calling the service number for RCS and it is 100%automated. Called Homeowners Financial again and they finally gave me a number to an actual person at RCS who told me I wouldn't even be in the system until the due date and I would be charged a $5 fee for making that payment  Which again made me feel like my wallet has been ganged up on by these people. Absolute confusion followed up by fees. \n\n In hindsight It was not worth the hassle and I am missing the ease of my initial mortgage. Unexpected fees and  horrible loan servicing, I wouldn't refer them to anybody.","10524":"Good variety on the menu\nDecent pricing\nDelicious food \nGood service \nGood ambience\n\nThe food came out pretty fast\nThe server was friendly & warm\nGood restaurant","10525":"I attended an after work event here a few days ago.  It was my first time visiting so I was pretty excited since they were on my list to try.  The appetizers included mac n cheese, hummus, meat and cheese, potato croquettes, bruschetta and a few other apps that were simply not memorable. I did enjoy the blueberry peach mule, it was flavorful and light.  Although I wasn't impressed on this visit, I do plan to return to try brunch .","10526":"The food was amazing, the service was great! I had the tacos and they come in sets of 3 and you can choose three different kinds. I went with carne asada, jerk shrimp, and carnitas. Carnitas was by far the best but they were all delicious. Boyfriend had the chicken poblano enchilada and they were amazing. I believe our servers name was Karmen and she did an amazing job. Friendly, personable and knowledgeable. I will definitely be going back next time I'm in Vegas!","10527":"We came in after a flight into Las Vegas. The server spent a ton of energy trying to get us to fill out an online survey about her. She even went as far as to tell us what to write. It was an awkward moment  when she asked us if we had completed it yet to get our $5 off. \n\nThe food was ok, nothing to write home about. I would say more about the food then the staff. The meal was spoiled by the regular survey questions from our server.","10528":"If anyone has come to the apple store, you know this place is a jumbled mess of people needing help either buying, returning or working\/transferring their apple products.\nTHIS place is always packed. There is even a pre-line that you need to wait in to put yourself in the query for help. I always tell myself to make an appointment as I want to slam my head into the wall as I wait in the query line to get help. But every time i go, I never make an appointment. \nRegardless, I went there return the apple watches that I got my husband and I because his digital crown was always getting stuck and mine the band although I had it for only a week, kept getting dirty and on top of that it was always freezing and had a hard time linking to my iPhone even when it was literally almost touching it. anyways enough about the problems of the watch, they needed to be returned. \nAs I waited in the \"pre-line\" to get the item returned, not just 1, but 2 tourist jumped in front of me and didn't give a crap about cutting in front of me. I made a very loud comment about how \"I can't believe people just cut in line\" and the asian girl in front of me just ignored me. The worst is that the \"query\" person putting the people in the line to get help proceeded to help the 2 people in front of me even when he saw me standing there waiting for him. \nAt this point I was just frustrated because there is no reason to be getting all wrighulghed up at the apple store. After my name was put in the query, I proceeded to wait for about 10-15 for a simple return. \nThe best part about this place was when I finally got help from Sarah to return my item, it that the return took less than 2 minutes. \nAll in All, there is no other way to deal with the apple store and a return shouldn't be so frustrating.","10529":"Not a bad place.\n\nThat 3.75\/day Consolidated Facility Charge that is tacked on every rental is a trip though...I thought that's what we were paying the Concession Recovery Charge for???\n\nOh well..easy access from the airport via shuttle. Plenty of gas stations nearby so you can fill up right before return. Easy access to the Strip via 3 right turns.\n\nHuge garage where you can usually pick your own vehicle after getting your paperwork.","10530":"Love this place! New ownership\/management has improved the place sooo much! That and it's awesome  location make for an amazing experience!","10531":"Overall, I like the workout I get here.  I've been attending their early morning classes for about 20 days (just finished their intro deal), and so far so good. Be aware they are very strict on their start and stop times, so allow for a little extra time to get there just in case your clock doesn't quite match with theirs. Their staff also seem very knowledgeable about what they do here, and are approachable if you have concerns. Each class is very consistent and is taught the same way, so, for example, if you come in for Topaz it'll be the same class no matter who teaches it. I've seen some people on here complain about that, but I personally like that so that I know what kind of class I'm coming in for that day.\n\nUpdate: 7\/29\/2016\nSo in the time I've been working out at Arrichion, I have to say my opinion of the place could only improve!  I've been attending their classes consistently for about 2.5 years now, and thanks to Arrichion, I officially fell in love with yoga, got my RYT200 certification, and now get to teach yoga to little kids at my kids' daycare!  I also dropped from a size 14 to a size 6 and have toned up in a way I haven't been since high school!  The owners and staff here truly LOVE what they do every day and it shows!  You truly can't beat the heat here either...it's the hottest yoga studio in town! \nThe only significant drawback here is the lack of showers. There is only one small shower room that everyone has to share. In the evening when you can go home stinky it doesn't matter so much, but in the morning right before work showering is a must. Luckily I can keep the workouts I love at Arrichion and use other options closer to work to take care of the shower. :)\n#arrichionstrong","10532":"I have heard amazing things about this restaurant.  Not sure why everyone loves it so much.  The service was just okay (not horrible) not something you'd expect from a 5 star restaurant.  The biggest let down of all was having to settle for a regular bone in ribeye when I went for the signature dish (the one in all the marketing) 44oz bone in ribeye served on a bed of lobster Mac and cheese.  I was told they were sold out shocking as the restaurant was empty and it was only 6:00.  Skip this place there are many amazing places to eat in Las Vegas!","10533":"The salad was tasteless, eggplant starter was ok and the pizza was dry and not much taste there either. The place itself is nice and relaxing.","10534":"The service is very fast. Pita bread was fresh and just baked. We came with a persiana friend and everything she ordered for us was absolutely amazing. We finished it all. Very affordable and we had great dinner.","10535":"i have been going here for almost 3 years.  Over the last year my dog has hesitated every time I start to go in.  Pulls away not wanting to go.  I noticed the haircuts were not as good.  Same person grooming all the time, very uncaring.  Last time was the final straw, cut his whiskers and eyelashes.  She actually shaved the hair by his eyes so close you could see his skin. .","10536":"I always get the Cantonese Chow mien here! \n\nNot the best Cantonese chow mien I have had, but for $10 you can't beat it. \nKind of a dirty place, I would only go for takeout.","10537":"Seeking a light lunch, we headed to this restaurant again for the al pastor tacos.  What separates this restaurant from its competitors is the expanded condiment that includes a variety of salsas, grilled jalapenos and scallions, pickled carrots, radishes, beans and more.","10538":"Delicious hot dogs loaded with chunky and funky melange of toppings! Huge portions. Everything is made fresh. \n\nTry the bulgogi (so much meat!) or Hawaiian (bacon and pineapple!). \n\nSkip the chicken wings (or get the sauce on the side, otherwise it will get soggy).","10539":"Dr. Romine fit me in on a short notice to deal with a squamous cell issue.  She was prompt and professional as well as warm and considerate.  I also found her staff to be delightful and very accommodating.  So glad to be back in the care of this office.","10540":"Short wait on a Sunday morning brunch.  Probably about 10 minutes.  Pay before you enter.  Nice selection of food.  Some decent vegetarian options.  A couple of carving stations.  Omelets, sushi, Asian, fruits, breads, American, Seafood, desserts, etc.  \n\nAll the food I ate was pretty good - I didn't send back any plates full of food.  I'm not really a hog-trough eater - but it was nice to a variety of food to choose from.  I would probably not go back, unless I was with someone that really wanted to go.  For that matter, I will probably not go back to a buffet in Vegas - or anywhere else.\n\nWait staff was great!  The desserts were great!","10541":"after waiting a legit freakin hour i get my crepe. The Napoleon: crepe filled with lemon curd?, blackberries, raspberries and perhaps blueberries topped with some whipped cream= holy shit that is good. An hour wait is an hour wait but those crepes are good. I would come here when it is not peak hours (I came around 11- was there till about 12:30) My peep got the Favorite and he said that was bomb as well. Maybe next time i will share and get a savory as well as a sweet crepe. Also Crepes are all $10, but they are huge and well worth it.. What is not worth it is their small coffee which is priced at $3. Buy your Crepe here and your coffee at the cafe next door. Iced Mochas are only $4 next door. Way better price.","10542":"Best Mexican food in Vegas! Fajitas were amazing- homemade tortillas- delish sopapillas- stellar service. 5 stars all the way","10543":"I went here today for some coffee and maybe something to eat.  \n\nThe door was opened for me upon approaching it, and I was warmly greeted by a man who I assumed to be the owner.  That was awesome.\n\nGetting inside, there are children crawling around on the ground and on furniture, literally screaming... and it smells.\n\nI walked up to the counter and a girl said \"hi,\" I said, \"hi,\" and I looked  up at the menu to see what I wanted... I kept looking and kept thinking and she remained silent and just stared at me.... this is not the kind of service I expect at a coffee shop... maybe some suggestions, or questions... \"so is this your first time here?\" would have been nice.  Just silence.\n\nI ended up just ordering a toddy, and it was okay.  I prefer the ones from Cartel most definitely though. \n\nI went to throw my straw wrapper away and the counter with forks and condiments and sugar and whatnot was visibly sticky and gross.  There was a bin with a sign over it reading \"dirty dishes,\" that was indeed FILLED with dirty, smelly dishes.\n\nThe owner thanked me and said goodbye on my way out.","10544":"Called for help and he came out immediately to change out our door locks. Main front door and back door. Made several copies for us. Fast and very professional.  Everything he needed he had with him. Price was fair. I wouldn't hesitate to give him a call.","10545":"Great if you're looking to earn the official ' I drank 200 different beers in this poor excuse for a bar\" jacket. File it next to your Hard Rock Cafe embroidered bomber. Intolerable music, overly lit for tying one on. Walls covered in kitschy-antique looking beer signs and plaques like \"be a sweetie and wipe the seatie\" that make one want to go on a murderous rampage. Everything that is wrong with bars. Period. And 15 tv's all on one wall, just in case there were 15 different television programs you just had to leave your house and watch. If this place wins one more \"Best Beer Selection\" award, I'm killing that iguana.","10546":"The North beats the South in this one. The outlet here is closer to you if you are staying on the south side of the strip but if you can, make the trek up to the North outlets. It has improved a lot since I last came when it was the BELZ outlet center so it's getting there but not up the standards of the north.\n\nThe shops are pretty plentiful. Remember to check in at the guest services center for a free coupon box. (Could be handy if you plan on splurging) The whole complex is a mish mosh of stores. Not as high end as the ones in the North but there are some decent ones. There seemed to be a lot of empty shops as well.  Get your walking shoes on because it is one LONG straight path from the top to the bottom. If you want more shopping, there is an outside promenade with some more shops!\n\nSo get your shop on. It's aite but if you have the time and the money, I'd hit up the north ones afterwards or instead.","10547":"I can count how any times I have been with 1 hand. The last time we went will now be the last time we ever go. Anything that could have gone wrong, Did! I ended up having to get my kids there drinks from the bar 45 minutes after we ordered. Food was cold and soggy; could not tell the server cause we could not find her for 30 minutes.","10548":"Definitely something different I have ever tried here in Las Vegas by far! Sooooooo delicious it's worth your extra spendings!!! Substitutions is a plus do not complain about their extra charge on substitutions because honestly it's so tasty! \n\nAtmosphere is clean, the employees here are attentive and professional. Music is good to me and their tv shows is great you got sports and the other side is the food channel.\n\nTheir serving amount is huge!!!!! Don't forget to check in for your 10% off! I recommend everyone to eat here.","10549":"Nice little mom and pop type place. Had a ham and cheese sandwich and the bread tasted awesome and fresh. lettuce and tomoato on sandwich was fresh as well. my side was macaroni salad and it was good. same macaroni salad you would find at other places. restaurant was a nice little place and the owner was very friendly.","10550":"Sunday brunch was $31 (including tax and 18% tip because I came with a party of 7), and the main reason we came was for the prime rib. It's really depends on what cut you get; my friend had part of the middle which was dry, but the BF had the side which was super flavorful and moist. He even got a little bit of fat which made it that much better. \n\nThe other plus from the meal was the omelet station. We went for an egg white only omelet that was exceptionally good; I regret not getting a second. Other than that, nothing particularly stood out. I liked the broccolini, caesar salad, the glazed carrots, and the dessert (caramel flan). The french toast was really dry and the fish was overcooked. I do like the fact that there is a lot to choose from, and our server was very attentive which made the experience (slightly) better.","10551":"Have used Dollar for years as an Express Member. The experience I had last nite however was disappointing and the experience I had with reservations this morning and the corporate office were equally disappointing. After arriving at Dollar late last nite with an Express reservation I was informed there were no cars. I was told to come back in the morning. As my vacation home is in South west Vegas this presented a dilemma. Getting no assistance from staff I went to Hertz who by the way owns Dollar to see if they would honor my reservation. After dealing with a condescending Hertz manager who was unable to assist in any way I made a reservation by phone with Hertz as I stood in line for 45 minutes. Only later did I find out that they were unable to locate the phone reservation and I had to make a second reservation.  Upon finally reaching the desk I was told only huge gas guzzlers were available or a Mercedes at $75 a day. Beware of Dollar and Hertz. They are not customer oriented. Sad!!!!!!","10552":"When it comes to casinos, old time = always better to me. That's pretty much my review right there. Gambling limits a\/o 2018 are unbeatable. Quarter increments on craps, I think from like 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. weekdays. 10 cent roulette chips, dk the hours.  $1 Blackjack. Small sportsbook. Everything is sort of in one big square of a room, with the restaurant in back. Food is diner quality at best, but who cares when you're paying $1.89 for breakfast? Big fan. Only problem is you have to drive 25 miles from LV to get there.","10553":"I went here twice in two days. The first for lunch, where I had the salad with tuna, hard boiled egg, oven dried tomatoes, and haricot verts and a GF peanut butter bacon cookie. The cookie was so amazing! I was dubious at first of the flavour but was really surprised at how much I liked it! If you're looking for a quick salad, this is a good option because they are pre-made with your choice of dressing on the side.\nThe next day I came back for breakfast with a friend. Although the experience was fine, I was a little bit irked with the service. First, we wanted to share the \"frittata\" and a smoothie. It is unclear on the menu that it's actually a frittata sandwich served on a roll. Being gluten free, my friend asked for a substitute for the bread -- anything without wheat. The girl helping us said we could get the granola\/yoghurt INSTEAD of the bread, but when we went to check out she charged us for the whole parfait. If I hear \"instead of\" without a follow up of a price change, I assume it's for free and don't want to be charged for it. We ended up having just the frittata without bread which was fine. The other problem was that I asked for almond milk for my coffee and the girl said they didn't have any almond milk but could give me soy milk. But we had ordered the \"April smoothie\" which had almond milk in it and when I asked about that she said, \"oh right, I was going to make it with soy milk.\" We ended up not having a problem with the soy milk, but I think it's dangerous to not mention it because it is possible we had a soy allergy and specifically ordered the smoothie because of the almond milk! We didn't mind the soy milk in the smoothie at all, but I think it is something they should have mentioned to us before making it.\nI wanted to get another peanut butter bacon cookie, but they said they don't sell them at breakfast which is a huge bummer! I hope I can come back and have it again another time soon.","10554":"We came in around 9AM on a Saturday morning and got a table for 3 without any wait. By 10AM, is when the place gets crowded and 1 hour waits begin.\n\nBy the name Eggstacy, we were expecting an out of this world egg breakfast experience. We ordered coffee, fresh squeezed strawberry pomegranate juice, the fried truffle egg toast, stuffed brioche french toast, prosciutto flat bread, a side of bacon and hash browns. The main dishes ranged from $12-14 each.\n\nService was great and our food came within 15 minutes after our order. The portions are huge and initially the food looked inviting.\n\nFresh squeezed strawberry pomegranate juice-Delightful, crisp and refreshing. Highly recommended!\n\nCoffee-Not particularly smooth, a little bland, average.\n\nFried truffle egg toast-It came out as two pieces of French toast. The first piece had the fried egg, asparagus, fontina cheese, and truffle butter. The serving was large and was sufficient to leave one feeling very stuffed.\n\nProsciutto flat bread-This was our least favorite dish. It seemed like the prosciutto, roasted tomatoes, asparagus, parmesan, fried egg, and balsamic reduction was carelessly tossed onto the bread. It was extremely salty. \n\nStuffed Brioche French Toast-This was our favorite dish and works well as a breakfast dessert. I loved the stuffed mascarpone, bananas, and nutella.\n\nBy the name Eggstacy, we were expecting spEGGtacular or EGGcellent, but instead it was just rEGGular. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here or wait, but if I were in the area early in the morning, I might try it again.","10555":"The employees were super rude and their wigs were not good at all they smelled like Barbie hair. This place needs to be shut down.","10556":"Just average for dinner on a thursday.  People were great food was not. More along the line of a 10.00 buffet. We used a coupon from my vegas so it was buy one get one free.  Wont be back :(","10557":"It was a really great experience.... very good customer service and got a great relief after the massage is done. I would recommend this salon for sure .","10558":"Great pizza, great price! \nAlways walk in here for a slice and a pop when I'm in the Durham region for work. Service is good and quick. Pizza is delicious. They seem to doing a good business as a lot of people walk in to pick up their pizzas. Price is very good, cheaper than most places.","10559":"When next looking for something delicious in the easy East, I will definitely return to Brickworks Cider House! Sweet staff, sweeter snacks and the sweetest cider. \n\nI popped into BCH with a colleague before a work event and we each had a cider flight. I'm not a huge cider drinker, but I really enjoyed all of the different flavour options. I especially liked their Hawaiian pineapple infused offering. Delish. \n\nAlong with our ciders we also shared an artichoke dip bread bowl thing. A loaf of crispy, cheesy bread that you tear apart filled with green goodness. It's definitely a full day's calories... but it's worth it.","10560":"The overall experience was lower than I rated it because I have been here before and it was a great experience. On this visit, It took over an hour and 20 minutes to get our food! Half of our groups food was cold. The entire dinner took over 2 hours.","10561":"My boyfriend wanted to spend his birthday weekend in Las Vegas, so I wanted to surprise him with a birthday cake. I began doing my research and came across this. We live in Los Angeles, so it was really hard picking a bakery from another state without tasting anything, but I gave it a shot. I worked with them through email and they were so helpful. I told them my idea and they came through with a wonderful cake. My boyfriend is a huge baseball fanatic so I wanted a baseball field. We stayed at the Rio and they were able to deliver it to us at the hotel for a small extra charge. When it arrived and I saw the final product, I was amazed. He absolutely loved!! Not only did it look amazing but it tasted great. If I ever have something else to plan in Las Vegas I will definitely order a cake from here.....Thank you so much for such an amazing cake!","10562":"I wasn't impressed at all. I was really excited to go, but the music was sooo loud and the dancers just weren't that great. I had a headache from the noise by the time I left and my head was ringing when I went to bed. The guys either looked high, bored, or tired, and the choreography needed way more rehearsal. Went on a Thursday. Not worth the money.","10563":"Huge buffet with many choices, reasonably priced and included all you can drink house wine or beer! It's not the best buffet that I've been to but definitely isn't the worst either. I would definitely recommend it to someone who's looking for a reasonably priced buffet!","10564":"This library is a little gem hidden in East Las Vegas. The building itself is super clean, colorful and spacious. They host many free children's programs and screen new-release movies about once a month. The staff is very helpful and friendly. They have a fairly large collection despite their size, with tons of movies and music CDs.\n\nThe free wi-fi is easy is to use and fast to boot. If you live the area, you should definitely check this library out!","10565":"Not only is this bar super cool and fun, but last night I lost my wallet there with over 500$ in it (yes I know I was stupid for having that much cash on me), and someone turned it in to staff who then called me and I had it returned with ALL the money still in it. They wouldn't even accept any reward money and even did a free shot with me when I went in to pick it up. Not only was it amazing that someone at the bar turned it in, but the staff totally could have been like \"let's split this money and tell her it was taken\". Kudos to your amazing staff, I'm so thankful. Good vibes all around at this place!!!","10566":"Having changed jobs recently, I was tasked with finding a new barber near work for a quick hair cut during lunch time. I found Adam Barbershop near St. Lawrence Market, just on the other side of Jarvis south of Front. \n\nThe owner, Youssef, was pleasant and we had a quick chat while he expertly cut my hair. He made some suggestions for length and style which I appreciated. Once the cut was finished, he trimmed my side burns and neck with a razor and I was on my way.\n\nOverall, a solid four stars and not overly expensive at $22. Youssef will also do a quick clean up if you need one, no need to pay the full amount just for that.\n\nThere were two people ahead of me when I arrived at lunch time and I was still in and out in 30 minutes. Just what you need when you are pressed for time.","10567":"The food here is great and so is the friendly staff. Ling and Louie's has everything going for it except the feeling of an Asian restaurant as it's a mix of Southwestern influences...Nothing wrong with that..just not plain Asian..\n\nThere are a couple of great choices on the menu especially the Evil Jungle Princess and the chicken and rice soup, and some of the appetizers are downright killers sch as the chicken lettuce cups and the chicken skewers.\n.\nA word on Houston; the bartender...that guy is bad ass in every sense of  the words...it's just not the same when he is not there...He is cordial, warm, friendly, fuzzy, extremely kind and just a real pro..I can't say enough nice things about him and even the other bartenders there cannot measure up to him...\n\nMy first review of Ling and Louie's was a little harsh at first but all my experiences since then have been consistently excellent. The management is top notch and never afraid of any criticism nor to make up for it...\n\nUpgrading my review to four stars because Yay I'm a fan and yes they deserve it...","10568":"I came in to repair my sunglasses-- couldn't find a screw anywhere that would fit!  The owner greeted me, and was so kind!  He repaired my sunglasses free of charge, and also included a eye glass cleaner for free. If you're looking for a great place to give your business that in return will give you 100% customer satisfactory, this is your place. Thanks again for all your help!","10569":"Deserve 0 stars. Need new remote and asked about that. Was told remote was $35-$45 and programming would be $25. Took me asking 3 times to even get that info. Was told tech could tell me when arrived but I wanted to know before hand. Made an appt for between 11am-2pm for remotes and programming. 2 o'clock rolls around and nobody shows. I called at 2:03 inquire about lateness. Tech was on his way, approx 15 mins out. I asked about a free remote or programming since late. Was told no they don't do work for free. I asked why they set appts they aren't keeping then. And asked to cancel then. Tech sounded angry and asked so you don't want us to come out because we won't work for free? I started to say no but a discount should be offered because you can't keep your appts and was hung up. \nCalled back to speak with a manager. Was busy so gave my name and number. We'll see if they bother calling back.","10570":"I normally don't edit these reviews but I wanted to follow-up with my latest experience this afternoon.\n\nI returned this afternoon because since this latest restring I have experience an unusual amount of movement in the main strings. Very frustrated with this, I wanted to see what could be done to fix this. \n\nThe most viable solution seemed to be putting on a thicker string, but I still can't figure out why the play is so dramatically different from the prior 2 stringings. \n\nStill, I appreciate that the manager seemed to have been reading Yelp and asked me to correct one issue he had with my review. \nApparently, the store was able to restring (the 2nd time) the racquet the same day, but simply neglected to call and notify me. \n\nI should note that he offered to restring the racquet with a thicker main string (I use natural gut on the cross strings) for $20. That seems to be their cost for the string (which is really pricy and needs to be replaced in both directions). As I hadn't budgeted the $20, I will have to put it off or forego it until the next string. $70+tax for a restringing is really eating into my pocket money.\n\nMy new star rating is 3.5 stars, rather than 3 as indicated above. To be sure, I am a tough reviewer so 4 seems too high at this point, but it is not impossible so long as the store continues to improve their customer service and we see some improved planogramming. As a steady customer, I am looking forward to seeing the progress.\n\nI would add another insight that I hadn't mentioned before. I really think the store has a good demo racquet program. For $30, they will let you swap out 2 demo racquets at a time for 30 days. At the end of the program, you get that same $30 off of the purchase of the racquet (in-store not online).\n\nThe only limitation to the program is that you need to put on your own overgrips to get an optimal feel for the racquet. Also, you don't get to choose the strings that go on the demo racquets (obviously), so you aren't necessarily going to get a perfect idea of how the racquet will play after you get it. Still, if you are a beginner player, strings may not matter so much to you.\n\nAdditionally, Wilson the US Open tennis balls are competitively priced at $2.39 each + tax and the selection of over grips and strings seems to be at least as good if not better than other stores I have visited. Additionally, if you research prices on their site and they do not match the in-store price, they are happy to honor the online price. Not bad for a brick-and-mortar.\n\nThe original review:\n\n\"I have very mixed feelings about this place. On the one hand, the prices for many (but certainly not all) products are competitive (even versus most web sites), which is nice to have locally. Their sale items are usually not amazing. Not a great place to go for sales, in my experience.\n\nOn the other hand, you have to put up with an inexperienced, sometimes rude staff. It's a bit like going to one of those hole-in-wall\/diamond-in-the-rough barbecue places. \n\nBy inexperienced, I don't mean to say the owner\/employees don't know tennis. They know that pretty well- more so than say a big box store. What I mean to express is that they are inexperienced with customer service.\n\nA recent example would be a re-string I had done there. All About Tennis stores re-string information in the computer, which makes for a simplified process when dropping off your racquet. Because they don't always re-string your racquet right away, they store the information that includes your preferences. So last week I dropped my racquet off and told them I wanted the usual hybrid string setup. My father had to pick the racquet up 2 days later, as I didn't have the availability to pick it up myself (they close very early - 6pm, which is too early for a retail store). He brought the racquet home and I discovered immediately that the wrong strings had been put on it. So I called the store and they said to bring it by to fix the mistake. So I brought it back the next day, and they had me leave it again because they couldn't get back to it. The worst part of this experience was that when I took the racquet back, the owner\/manager got into an argument with me saying that he had simply \"put the same strings on as had been taken off\". An obvious lie which serves no good for him. Indeed, his own staff (much younger) advised him that he had indeed put the wrong strings on the racquet. (By the way, these strings look nothing alike, so i cannot fathom how this mistake was made!)\n\nSo 5 days and a $55 restring - I'm not too happy about the poor customer service, so I will start looking for someone else to restring my racquet. At the very least they should be comping the labor for their screw up, especially considering all the drive time, gas, etc. that this debacle has cost me.\n\nSeparately, the showroom could do with a little sprucing up. Wouldn't take much I think, but some elbow grease would go a long way.\"","10571":"Culligan Total Water Treatment Systems is really a great company to work with and I love their service! \n\nWe have one of their products at work (a counter-top, plumbed water cooler) that was having some issues. I called in and spoke to the nicest gentleman who was able to get me through to who I needed to talk to, and then Reed was able to get a tech out the very same day. That's almost unheard of! \n\nThe tech who showed up was very friendly and knowledgeable and was able to get our older machine swapped out quickly. I was very impressed at how efficient he was. \n\nThe service is great. The product is great. And the price is great! No complaints. Definitely recommend!","10572":"Had a business meeting there today and a mouse was running around the main dining area. Employees tried to catch it for about 5 minutes, but gave up. Wonder where it went?","10573":"Love the breakfast here! Tastes like a home cooked meal.  Portions are huge! Usually have leftovers to take home, the prices are great, the servers are extremely friendly that give your great recommendations! Can't go wrong here for breakfast.  I pick this place over Denny's, ihop, and village in any day of the week!","10574":"Came here once few years ago , there are more kind of food and all look delicious., nowadays it's getting more expensive and less food but still look ok though and it's look clean , nice staff ., love here to give work to elderly., just see their happy friendly smile it's worst more than word could say ....","10575":"Always the best food, not the most healthy, but super delish!  I love the green chili burritos, tacos, beans, red chili burritos, you really cant go wrong here.  My only recommendation would be to have salsa pre-packaged to go.","10576":"I am delighted I found this place. I have been wanting for years to get some med-spa treatments for my aging face, but have never been able to afford it. The pricing of these student-applied procedures is very reasonable and they also offer discounted specials several times throughout the year for additional savings. I've become a regular here since November of '14 and have already had a number of services for just a few hundred dollars that would have easily cost me in the thousands at a regular med-spa.\n\nYes, the procedures are done by people who are still learning, so you need to be flexible and ready to accept some inconsistencies in the delivery of service. But it's a total win-win. The students gain real-world experience and you gain a better complexion. I certainly have!\n\nSo far, all of the student aestheticians have been women and they have been competent, friendly, fun and dedicated to doing a good job. They are seniors who have nearly completed the program and are thoroughly supervised by instructors who seem very knowledgeable. Also, since it's a school, they adhere very strictly to standards of cleanliness and proper procedures. If they err, it's more on the side of being careful. I have not had a bad experience.\n\nThe only down sides for me are these: First, I've had service done by some gals with whom I was so happy, I would like to have a permanent working relationship with them. Sadly, while you are able to request repeat appointments with a student while they are still enrolled, they do eventually graduate and move on.\n\nThis leads to the second down side which is, you can't really establish a history with any one provider and you frequently have to start over from scratch in discussing your skin-care history and goals. As a result of this I've also gotten some conflicting advice regarding which and what frequency of services would best meet my needs. But hey, it's a school and I am using it as a learning experience, too, so I can make better use of the available services. Also, the medical Director of SWINA, Dr. Laree Hooker, has a private practice and, for the price of an office visit, you can make an appointment with her if you want professional advice in creating a treatment plan for yourself.\n\nOverall, I recommend this facility without reservation. Give them a try!","10577":"We have tried other cleaning services before but we will stick with Rhino. Friendly and courteous staff and they get the job done. We are very happy. Thank you!!","10578":"Best Massage ever. Ask for Yaret. Hands down the most relaxing experience I could have asked for. Her gentle hands works wonders.","10579":"Casa Rasta has very good food but I'm still not convinced that it will be part of my regular restaurant rotation.  If you're hungry for decent Mexican\/Caribbean fare, by all means go.  The food won't disappoint you and our waitress was wonderful -- very engaging but not over the top and annoying.  Our wait wasn't excessive but it was a bit trying, and it was also freezing -- we had to move tables.   CR has also landed a new location, perhaps after they work out some of the kinks, they can focus on the decor, which still has remnants of the previous restaurant Lunardis.  That aside, food was great -- I had a chorizo burrito, my husband had a goat burrito and my son had jerk chicken wings.  For dessert, we had a chocolate cheesecake that was far less cheesecakey than it was mousse-like.  Delicious.","10580":"Fantastic food and service. Good coffee too. I love the chop salad. Good little breakfast\/ lunch spot.","10581":"The blackened salmon was \nThey have my favorite Cali creamin on nitro  \nRaul our server killed it for us and our","10582":"A quaint little restaurant. Very quiet which was expected for a weekday evening. Food was great with the waiter referring to the \"Ossobuco\" as magic meat. Well I don't know if it was magical since I didn't see any sparks or flying pigs (flying veal?) but it was quite a tender piece of meat. My friend's whole wheat spaghetti was quite disappointing, such that she could not finish the dish.\nOverall not bad for an Italian restaurant, but would like to visit again to try out other menu items.","10583":"I thought I was going to dislike this place but I was wrong!  It's cheap but very fresh\/good quality food with a variety of other options for those who really are not that into breakfast food.  I came against my will (secretly whining like a big baby on the inside) but left thinking it could be a new regular lunch spot. I had a half sandwich and salad combo which was great! They don't skimp on toppings and the food was very flavorful considering that I expected it to be a health food joint.  Give it a try! Nikki likes it :)","10584":"Terrible service. Understaffed? Whatever it was was rediculous. 8 minutes to get our drink order. Twenty minutes to get the app which we ordered when we ordered the drinks and was all we ordered. And the pot stickers were either freezer burned or undercooked in the dough. Not thrilled needless to say. And never choosing to come here again.","10585":"very good spicy and creamy curries, great portions, decent thai beer selection and great service. good place to visit and i will be back for more. curry, rice, a beer, and generous tip = $22 a person. not a bad meal but this place just didn't blow me away. i'll come back if i'm in the area.","10586":"i would put 0 if it was offered. it is like pulling teeth to get them to show up on time, not cancel. or take 3 months to fix my phone correctly. thye sent me a \"flyer \" with my bill promising an 'around the clock service' offer. thye offered $20.00 off your bill if they did not show up ...canceled ... or came late...! but when it took them from jan - march to get my line repaired they had cancelled and been late and now ...will not honor their gaurantee? i have been with them 12 years and hate their customer service and their tech support \"practices\" ... basically mis-treating their customers...","10587":"Great food, and good service. After I had called in my order and Picked it up.. I got home to realize they had given me the wrong order, I called to tell them... and since I was close they delivered the right meal to my house.  Very happy that they dis","10588":"Ordered the caldo de res (beef soup) and it was good! Comes with the choice of flour tortilla, corn tortilla or bread. Only little thing was that the rice was saltier than I personally like but still good. Ate everything!  Also, on the table there is crush red pepper, oregano and dried red chilies, so that was nice.","10589":"Absolutely fantastic. \n\nIf you are looking for a quiet, relaxed, and delicious dinner...this is the place. We went once for dinner and it was fantastic. Loved the BYOB, food was great, and our waiter was very knowledgable with the menu. \n\nRecently we returned for Carmela's Cooking Class. Can't say enough about this experience. Delicious food cooked right in front of you. What other restaurant owner shows you how to make their food and gives you the recipe? Carmela sat with us after the class and talked about Italy. She made us feel so welcomed and comfortable. It felt like we were at a friend's house for dinner. It was a great experience!\n\nIf you are looking for authentic Italian food, you have to go. \n\nIf you are looking for a fun date night, you have to go. \n\nYou must try La Travola Italiana!","10590":"Hubby brought me here for my birthday a few weeks ago, and we had a great time! I chose an Asian-inspired halibut dish as my entree, and hubby got the dayboat scallops. Both were really good, although we both slightly preferred the scallops. And that bread basket... #feedme #carbs #bringmemore #noreallytheywillbringyoumoreifyouask \n\nAmbiance-wise, Spoon has a cool vibe, but there is also a small walled-in garden seating area that I would highly recommend if the weather's nice. Food-wise, I'll just leave this here: Of the hundreds of restaurant stalls at Pittsburgh's Best Restaurants event, Spoon's lamb-infused pasta dish was my #1.","10591":"I usually wouldn't wrote a review for a chain, but this place isn't too bad, they have yet to get my order wrong which lets be honest happens pretty often. Friendly service just wish the drive threw would be quicker, from 8am to 9:30 it's like a parking lot.","10592":"Great place to grab a local drink! Portside is off the beaten path of downtown, which is nice since it's never crazy busy, and nothing is better than being next to the lake! They have a solid list of local beers and you have the option to make your own sampler if you don't want to commit to 16oz of one beer. They also have great cocktails made with local spirits (during the holidays I recommend the apple cider + spiced rum)! Food menu isn't amazing but they have enough to get by and what they do have is solid quality and flavor. Overall this is definitely one of my favorites when looking for a local hangout with a great atmosphere!","10593":"Yummy Portuguese home-style take-out. Lunch deals, fresh salads and you can buy whole chickens!","10594":"House band was OK.  I ordered a Guiness....which is a little strange I guess in a redneck bar.  The beer cost $8....I gave a $10 and received $12 change.  I wish the casino was like this!  Of course I corrected the mistake.\n\nI didn't order any food because it was 1am or so.  I did see the clientele at this time of night, and I must say it is nothing but older rednecks. I am from Texas...but come on.  Too many old rednecks.  They have their own dancing and mating rituals which I am still not accustomed.  \n\nThe main problem with the place is the location.  It is upstairs in a cubby hole.  Difficult to find and just strange.  I do not understand who thought the location was a good idea.  I believe the decision to place the bar in this area went like this:\n\nHarrah's Executive #1: \"So...what do we put in this isolated 'dungeon-like' place?\"\nHarrah's Executive #2: \"How about a redneck bar?\"\nHarrah's Executive #1: \"What exactly is a redneck bar?\"\nHarrah's Executive #2: \"A bar that attracts rednecks.\"\nHarrah's Executive #1: \"So how do we attract rednecks?\"\nHarrah's Executive #2: \"Get a country singer that likes guns and sings like crap to scribble his name all over it and put some cheesy crap that he touched throughout the place.\"\nHarrah's Executive #1: \"So....Toby Keith?\"\nHarrah's Executive #2: \"Bingo!\"","10595":"NEW CHEF!\n\nWe had been visitors before the remodel some years back and never made a visit to the remodeled El Chorro. While I miss the funky d\u00c3\u00a9cor of old Scottsdale, I like the updated version also! \n\nWe visited on a very chilly night and after a drink at the bar, my husband suggested we have our early dinner outside on the patio under all the heaters. I scoffed. It's really cold. The hostess suggested blankets. So she pulled out cozy blankets to cover our chilly laps! After sitting at our intimate table underneath the heaters, I really didn't need it and enjoyed the moonlit sky.\n\nOur server was Andre and he was great! Attentive and friendly without being too chatty. My husband had the sea bass and I had the pork tenderloin. We also had the wedge salad. Sticky buns yummy as always! Our food was moist, delicious and perfectly cooked. Soooo happy! Only complaint was that our wedge salad (which Andre had divided into two for us) had too much dressing on it.\nSecond complaint was that the food was so good, I overate. My pooch is sticking out as I write.\n\nIn our conversation, Andre mentioned that there was a new chef in the kitchen when we said how great our food was. Strongly recommend El Chorro.","10596":"Matthew does a excellent job. Professional, honest, friendly, and affordable. I recently had my roof replaced and the roofers left a screen over my exhaust vent that quickly clogged up. He quickly found problem and cleaned out the vent and restored the proper flow. Highly recommended.","10597":"OMG Fat Tuesdays is so good I went here every day for my 4 day trip in Vegas last week and it was awesome I mean when I said I came here every day I mean I came here every day and try different drinks. I have so many souvenir cups I couldn't even take them all home.  if you're going to be in Las Vegas  you need to hit up Fat Tuesdays. They have several different locations. I stayed at the Harrah's Hotel and Casino so this place is right outside of the hotel. My favorite part about this place is you can get extra shots added into your Blended cocktail my favorite was the mango rum with an added Malibu rum shot. Hits the spot just right on those hot days or nights!","10598":"Great no frills sushi place with friendly staff.","10599":"We came here on a Saturday night with a group of 7. Since there was a lot of us they recommend us getting omakase experience which is getting the server a price point that each of us is willing to pay and they can provide different dishes within that price range. On average, people would do $50 - $60 each. \n\nOne by one, we had several dishes come out. All of us enjoyed every dish and the notable ones are wagyu beef gyoza (so flavorful!), seared wagyu beef (perfect for large groups),  crispy yellowtail taquitos (fresh and full of flavor!), and the grilled fish\/chicken kabobs (not dry at all).\n\nService was fantastic, they were very attentive and giving us new plates, cleaning up our table, and providing new silverware when necessary. It was a couple of our party's 30th birthday and they gave us shots on the house, how sweet is that?\n\nI would definitely return while in Vegas!","10600":"Always had good pizza from here - it's a NY style and they have everything from your basic pizza toppings to more exotic topping combos as well. You can also buy their fresh dough if you are feeling like making a pizza at home. Delicious!","10601":"It's truly an amazing Wisconsin experience and one worth going to.  The interior is stellar - it's a converted farmhouse that is heavy on the wood with an eye catching bar when you walk in.  It's rustic without being too country and is the reason why it got an extra star from me.  The food, to be honest, was mediocre.  I had the pretzl batter fish fry, which was good, but not amazing.  The cheesy hash browns was a nice touch and definitely a plus on the dish.  I felt the need to dribble a little bit of hot sauce to counterbalance the cheesiness, but otherwise good.  Honestly, if you have the chance, it's worth stopping by for at least a drink and potentially a meal.","10602":"So I ate here one time with a group of my friends who had just returned from a trip to Peru.  I had their chicken fried rice, which was tasty, and it looked good, and it was really quite fine, but nothing spectacular.  The server was very nice and split our bill up for us which was nice since it was a group of 10.  He didn't even add gratuity on which was kind of surprising, although of the pleasant variety.  My friends all enjoyed their meals, and the arroz con pollo my friend had looked and smelled good too.  On the whole, I was happy with the meal and the service, but I doubt I'll be back here any time soon unless I'm in this part of town.","10603":"This place is a GREAT alternative to Tacos El Gordo. In fact, I think this place is much better than Tacos El Gordo. First, the actual venue is very nice. It is very clean, open and hip. I love how they have a line to separate the different meats you want in your tacos\/burritos\/quesadillas.  Closer to the cash register, is a bar and another line to order fries, nachos, corn, etc... \n\nThe food is delicious but I've only had Carne Asada tacos and Carne Asada fries. I have yet to try the corn and other meats. I'm sure they all taste great as they look delicious on everyone else's plates. \n\nThe venue also has a condiments area in the middle which is very very hearty with salsas, veggies and a few other fresh accompaniments to your food. \n\nLastly, the staff is very nice. I especially love the lady that serves in the line where you order your sides and extras (fries, corn, nachos, etc...). She is amazing!","10604":"Complete misrepresentation. Originally quoted one price and it went up by almost double upon delivery.  Dishonest and unprofessional. Should have trusted the negative reviews, but when I questioned it, was told that the company was under new ownership. \nWill definitely be doing more research if I am ever in need of moving services again.","10605":"This is hands down the best practice we have ever been to. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. They are always willing to work in a sick child and they REALLY listen to and work with the parents. Nikki and Deb are the BEST. There is not single doctor or nurse in any of the offices (and we have been to all of them) that we did not like or trust. \nI recommend this practice to every parent I know and any parent reading this review.","10606":"Amazing food down to amazing service!!! Definitely going back. My boyfriend and I fell in love the red jade chicken.","10607":"Great atmosphere for a decent Bloody Mary on a Sunday. Trendy little spot with big TVs makes it an awesome place for weekend brunch. I'd recommend making reservations tho, as it fills up pretty fast.","10608":"I love First Markham Place!  Not just because I live practically right next to it, but because their asian food court is one of the best in Toronto (voted #1 chinese food court in Toronto area for several years). \n\nLike many food courts, some come and go.  But you can always count on each stall having a huge selection and wide variety of asian food (Cantonese, Vietnamese, Western-Chinese, Thai, Hunan, Taiwanese, etc).  I had a friend who owns 88 Express (postal outlet) and says that rent is pretty expensive there.  Thankfully the price of food there is still cheap to be competitive.  Being an Asian food court, the food stalls are all open till 8 or 9pm every day of the week including Sundays, and closed during a non-peak weekday (usually a Monday or Tuesday).\n\nOh, and I have boy-cotted the Taiwanese stall because they gave my mom bad soy milk and ripped me off in change many years ago.\n\nThere are other snack places on one side of FMP including a relatively new one that has freshly made beef\/pork jerky (yummy!).\n\nComparing to Pacific Mall, I would say there are less stores, but a different selection of food court stalls (no more thai food at Pac Mall for example).\n\nI come here very often.  Has everything I need except for a TD Bank branch (they have China Bank ... LOL!) and a Canada Post outlet (they have these just down the street at Hwy7\/Warden).  Note that parking can be a pain sometimes during peak hours (weekends and weekday lunch time).\n\nAlthough I come here mostly for the food court, there are other notable shops including an official Rogers dealer (AmCall) and Wind Mobile.","10609":"MY absolute favorite Mexican restaurant!  They have 2 locations... 1 at Litchfield and Bell, and this one in El Mirage off Grand Ave.  I like both, but LOVE the Grand Ave original location.  On Sundays they have the annoying mariachi man thou.  ;\/  LOL","10610":"not that impressed. I really wanted pancakes from ihop but my boyfriend's mom wanted to come here, so had no say. They had 3 pancake selections to choose from - I ordered the lemon poppy seed and wasn't too impressed and the pancake texture was kinda cardboardy. I also wanted a side of hashbrowns, but their hashbrowns are actually potatoes, so that was another disappointment. I also ordered lemondae which tasted pretty weird and watered down. Only food I find impressive here is their bran muffin - it is very tasty with butter. The restaurant itself is nice and clean and nice service, but I am definitely not a fan of their food.","10611":"We ate here last Wednesday for the first time. Finding myself on my own tonight, I decided to go for takeout. I ordered the broccoli beef and it was DELICIOUS!! Lots of beef and broccoli in a yummy sauce.  Plus the serving size was enough for dinner and lunch tomorrow. This will definitely be our go to Asian place! I definitely recommend it.","10612":"This Starbucks is the slowest that I have seen in awhile but, the service of the staff is amazing. This Starbucks has the vibe of ones past that have surrendered the customers experience, but it's alive here and it is not fake. It's funny this Starbucks is in a touristy area but it is better for the service than most local neighborhood stores.","10613":"I LOVE this store! \n\nYet again on one of my lunch time travels I stumbled upon Used. Opening my horizons recently to vintage stores, I was surprised to find such a modern store with an extremely helpful employee :) \n\nOn the plus there was no \"used\" stench in store. The stores selection of goods was impressive in the fact that all the pieces were unique and affordable (either used or the few new pieces). Unlike Geraldine's experience I found the prices to be on the reasonable side. I purchased a vintage silk dress for $19 that looks exactly like a Hermes scarf pattern. Awesome! \n\nP.s. Talk about helpful staff, the dress I bought had 12 buttons running down the back. Unfortunately, one button as missing. The sales lady not only helped me look through a button box she had at the store, but after a failed attempt she recommended me to a store about a block down the street. I went to the store and another helpful employee helped me find the EXACT button for only $0.65!\n\nCan't wait to go back when more stuff is in!!","10614":"Dr. Devin Luzod is, without a doubt, the most professional and knowledgeable doctor I've seen. Other chiropractors I've visited have never come close to matching Dr. Luzod's expertise. His office staff is always cordial and makes you feel at home. They even serve fresh baked cookies! Dr. Luzod uses the superior gentle, quick, and most effective NUCCA adjustments. If you're in any kind of pain, I highly recommend Dr. Luzod due to his extensive knowledge and caring philosophy.","10615":"Food was decent. The filet was cooked correctly but seemeda little salty.  Sides and veggies were good.  Service was average at best.  For the price range of this restaurant I expected better.","10616":"We went there for the first time yesterday, and I would definitely recommend Spartan Pizza.  Here's why:\n- the crust is thin, crunchy on the bottom, chewy on top\n- the sauce is sweet and savory\n- the cheese is rich and delicious\n- the veggies were fresh and tasty\n\nWe ordered the Canadian bacon deluxe (with onions, green peppers, green & black olives, and mushroom too I think).  The Canadian bacon tasted like real meat and is among the best I've had ... not at all like that heavily processed stuff you usually get at the store.  The CBD is naturally quite salty from the bacon and olives but I like that.\n\nWe also had the small salad which was just iceberg lettuce and tomatoes, but what can you expect for $2?  I'd bet the pizza salad is much better.\n\nThe service was casual and friendly.\n\nIn regards to the atmosphere, we ate in the parlor booth area which is clean enough and family-friendly but quite dated in appearance.  We left through the adjoining room which is a bar that has been added on and is much more modern and was populated by locals drinking and eating dinner around the bar.\n\nI should also note that the plates for eating pizza are plastic.  This is a \"no frills\" kind of place.","10617":"Couldn't have had a better night out than last night at Zeppelin! Fantastic setting, knservice, enticing menu and","10618":"Have been here twice and the food did not disappoint.  The service is pretty slow (even though no one was in there) but they were super friendly and accommodating. Highly suggest!","10619":"We were looking forward to trying the pizza at this new  place and it did not disappoint, From the decor to the music to the service to the pizza menu, everything exceeded our expectations. My wife had the Carbeau and I had the Classique and both were delicious. Unfortunately, they did not give the same thought to their beer selection. They had the same generic Sapporo brands on tap instead of some great local beers (Boreal, St. Ambroise, Cheval, Dieu Du Ciel..... I could name a dozen more). It would have been nice to enjoy a couple of pints with that delicious pizza.","10620":"We have used Bark 'n' go for several months now to provide a self-service bath to our husky\/lab mix. \n\nThe facilities are great, and offer everything you need in one convenient location. The staff are warm, friendly and helpful and we have never had a bad experience. \n\nThe price is very competitive and worth the price as opposed to attempting to give him a bath at home.","10621":"Two minutes to Hersey Center. Great place to get breakfast and lunch.  They accommodated with everything we asked for and our kids are very picky. \nFood was very fresh and the owners were amazing. \nThank you for making us feel at home. \nFamily from NJ @ Jon Elkin goalie camp.","10622":"Very good service and food. I really like the menu selections.  I've only been here twice, once for lunch and for dinner and both times I left happy and full. Start with the meat or chicken Empanadas. The Parrillada Fierro was a great platter of meats perfectly seasoned. The Milanesa beef sandwich was also good. This is definitely a goto spot for me.","10623":"Setting:  This quick eatery is located near our home in the Happy Valley shopping center.  Out of all the eateries in this area, my wife and I rank this place above the rest.\n\nAmbiance:  Space is very limited although there is seating outside.  Typical fast food ambiance for take out or sit down.  However, it is not the ambiance that matters here, but the food is delicious!\n\nFood\/Menu:  My wife ordered the chicken kebab meal that comes with a drink and fries ($8.50) while I ordered the ultimate steak shawarma (sandwhich only $6.95, and you can also choose chicken).  We added 2 garlic sauces that cost $0.50 each.  Depending on how many people are there, the food does not take very long to come out.\n\nChicken Kebab - the chicken is seasoned well with great flavor, while the veggies and added garlic sauce in the pita bread compliment the meat.  The french fries are thick and are not too soft or too crunchy.\n\nUltimate Shawarma - the bread seems buttered with the right amount of crunch when you bite into it.  The steak, with the onions, tomato, and provolone combined make for a definite party in your mouth.  Tasty and savory sandwich.  This is a definite after party or late night treat!\n\nService:  They are family owned and do an excellent job of service.  No complaints!\n\nOverall:  The prices were listed above due to the fact that you are getting quality sit down Greek food at a reasonable price.  I have not tried the whole menu yet, as I have not gotten sick of the shawarma.  Overall, this is better than average Greek food with a good price.  Out of all the eateries here, we will definitely be seeing you again Greek Pita!","10624":"This place was absolutely awful. In August I paid them a deposit of $370. to recover 3 bar stools in black leather, with another $360. due when the job was done. After hearing nothing after 6 weeks I called a was told next week. This went on every week for another six weeks. I finally went in person and the guy said give me 2 days- supposedly they only just found where they put the chair.  Five days later I went in person again and once again nothing was done. I took my bar stool back and asked that they refund my Visa the $370. They claimed the guy who could do it wasn't in until Wednesday although there was only ever the one guy dealing with all transactions and he was the same guy who processed my Visa payment so total lie. Now I have to try to dispute these charges through my Visa. Totally don't recommend this place and whatever you do don't pay until the service is provided or you will be ripped\n\nUpdate some weeks later after some back and forth I did finally get my deposit refunded, so not a complete disaster","10625":"Mike Stoker and his team at Steel Creations are the finest steel fabrication shop in phoenix.  They have done work for myself and many of my friends.  True custom work is their specialty.  If you are looking for gates, pool fences, front security doors or most anything else made out of steel.  \n\nAll my friends who have used Mike love him and the work his firm has done.","10626":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile since I kept seeing their signs for 'street tacos'. I finally went in today to check them out. Ordered a couple barbacoa tacos and a chicken quesadilla with some salsa from the salsa bar. Everything was really good and the people working the front counter were very nice. I wouldn't hesitate to go back and try more dishes.","10627":"On the upside the decor is great, the service is adequate, and it's one of very limited options when you want real food at the airport when your flight is delayed and you can't make it home for dinner. Unfortunately, that's about where it ends.\n\nI think that they should rebrand the fish tacos as \"fork-free fish and chips\", because there wasn't even a lime wedge or cilantro to give a Mexican flair. Instead,  the fried cod was sitting on a bed of creamy coleslaw, a top a flour tortilla, served with a side of tartar sauce.\n\nOne more thing to keep in mind for jet setters,this is a real sit down restaurant in the airport, with ' real restaurant' wait times. Unless you're picking up premade food at the takeout counter, expect to wait a little while for your food.","10628":"Went here for a working lunch and he service was great! We went during a busy lunch I joe and got seated right away for 6 people. The ambiance was relaxing and the food was delicious and plentiful. The wait for the food wasn't bad either! Definitely a good spot if you want to have a business lunch or just a place to eat good food and get good service!","10629":"Delicious food! Wonderful service! We loved our night out in Pittsburgh because of this restaurant :)","10630":"How does this place not have 5 stars? The food is so omg good! The staff is always friendly and they always remind me that the red sauce isn't vegetarian, which is super helpful! The cornbread and the mashed potato enchiladas and so good! Definitely a great place for vegetarians!","10631":"I've been to the location in Chardon and it was great. I ordered a plain cheese pizza and it had decent flavor but the crust was really tough and seemed too dense. I prefer a more airy curst, tbh.","10632":"This is a long overdue review.   Max automotive is the best place you can take your vehicle to for repairs.   We had recently taken our 2001 explorer to a local dealership to look at and they quoted us over 2k to fix a supposedly broken condenser.   We were in a pinch and couldn't afford to shell out that much prior to a road trip to California with my family.   I reached out to Max and they were super helpful and got us in right away and quickly found out that the issue had nothing to do with the condenser and was simply a case of replacing some manifold hoses that were leaking.  600 bucks later we were good to go!  These guys are first class honest folks who go the extra mile to help you.   I would highly recommend them to any of my friends in a heart beat.  Thanks guys for helping fix our vehicle!","10633":"Second time visiting this place last night and I guess the old saying is true... \"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, can't blame Hot Taco\"\n\nServers that have no idea about the food on the menu, long waits for the mediocre food, gross house cocktails. The kitchen seemed overwhelmed and confused as we watched and waited for our food to come out lukewarm and flavorless, there is a guy with dreadlocks and ho hat cooking in an open kitchen (health department violation). This place has to be one of the worst concept ideas in restaurant history and now that there is a petition to have them remove the statues in front of the entrance I think it will be interesting to see how long until it is closed and revamped.\n\nDefinitely a huge miss for the Bottle Cap Group on this one, but I guess that sometimes some ideas look way better on paper.","10634":"They greet you when you enter the store but then they are done with you. We were looking for shoes for an adult woman, an adult man and an 8 year old girl so basically we were all over the store.  The entire time my granddaughter was trying on 8 different pairs of shoes two employees stood nearby having a conversation but never offering assistance. In fact a customer walked up to them and waited for them to stop talking and turn to him which they never did and he left in disgust.  I gave up looking for shoes for myself because I was too annoyed with the store  .  When I paid for my Granddaughters shoes the cashier asked if I wanted some kind of loyalty card and I said no I would not because I did not plan on ever returning and told him about the lack of assistance.  He didn't care.   They had shoes I was interested in but never found.  For the price of their shoes you would expect a little assistance.","10635":"Goodfellas is extremely reliable, very efficient, and there's such sweethearts working there!! \nThey treated me with an awesome service as well as great attitudes! I'm very pleased with the work they did on my 2016 Maserati!!!!! This place was fast and very friendly. I'm really surprised there's still amazing shops here in Las Vegas. . . \nI'd definitely bring my vehicle back here if I ever get hit again!! \nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND GOODFELLAS TO EVERYONE NEEDING TO HAVE THEIR VEHICLES REPAIRED! \nEXCELLENT WORK!","10636":"Got brow extensions here- and they were so awful, the customer service I received afterwards was even worse. I had to take them all off once I got home, she never cleaned off my eyebrows to begin with and glued the hairs directly on my eyebrows, not my skin. They were going in all different directions and falling off. They looked extremely fake which is not what the pictures looked like. I couldn't brush my eyebrows or even try to fill them in a little to hide how they looked because they were literally HARD. You could see the glue everywhere. It felt like I just took a bunch of plastic eyebrow hairs and soaked them in elmers glue and pressed them randomly onto my eyebrows. I texted the lady who did them afterwards, she was very nice while doing them, but she wouldn't give me a refund or even a partial refund and I had to take them all off, which ripped out some of my real eyebrow hairs! Big waste of money.","10637":"The food is good, not great! Priced decently and busy but that's where the issue comes in! First the positive... the waitress did a great job, food came out sorta promptly. We had a large party 11 folks, the reservations were attempted on line, but because the group was over 6 people we were required to call the location directly. We were told \"the entire party had to be there before being seated\" ... we initially had planned for 5pm but told 6 - 6:15 was best they could offer to seat the entire party together. Everybody was there by 5:45 and the reception area was n9tified we were all ready... we were still on track for 6pm as a large party had just been given the check... so it wouldn't be long. Surprisingly another large party of 13 were told that the table was being held and would be given to the next in line if they were not ready. Not everybody had yet arrived, and the restaurant seated 5 of the 13 and the rest wandered in later. (Contrary to the \"all must be present before party seated\" rule..... special circumstances or they were buddy buddy with someone)  when one of the managers was questioned about lighting a fire under the party \"that had been given their check (now 6:05).. the manager said \"We figure an hour to an hour fifteen\" so they would ask the folks relaxing after another 20 minutes, and we'd all be seated at that time.\" \n  When we did get seated (for a birthday dinner) instead of being seated together, the party was split between 2 tables across the busy aisle exiting the kitchen.....Los much for being seated together!  One would expect if they couldn't seat the entire party together in the first place they would not have taken a large reservation in the first place! \n My serious recommendation if your party is under 4 people, make reservations by phone and still anticipate 20-30 minute wait. If your party is 6 or more, consider another restaurant such as longhorn, or outback first! At least you won't be appreciated as a patron. The initial service received by the 2 managers and reception staff along with seating arrangement spoiled the evening and dining experience! \n In the future, I may try a different location, but like others in our party will neither recommend or go to this location ever again!","10638":"Mr. Hammond was the seller's agent and I was the buyer.  At the very least, one would think the seller's agent would do whatever it took to make the selling process go smoothly in the interest of closing the transaction.  However, it seemed Mr. Hammond decided he would throw as many \"roadblocks\" in the way as possible, from negotiation to inspections to repairs to closing to even providing all of the keys for the property.   While legally his role is to represent the seller, he provided no assistance to the buyer or the buyer's agent -- seemingly just to prove he didn't have to.  I wonder if Mr. Hammond realizes what kind of impression his \"do nothing, care less\" attitude leaves on prospective future customers -- ESPECIALLY since he's a \"highly touted, award winning realtor\" with the sixth largest online realty company:  ZIP REALTY.","10639":"Let me start off saying that we want ALL Phoenix restaurants to thrive.\n\nWe popped in on Sunday late morning 3.1.15 all knowing that Gallo Blanco was no longer and wanted to have a nice experience at a former fave spot of ours. We were disappointed. I try not to write negative reviews but we left the restaurant upset and feeling was we just wasted our time and money....The food and service was terrible. \n\n-The bar was dirty and unkempt, terrible first impression.\n-Staff stood at the bar while one pregnant server chatted about her personally aches and pains as we ate. Gross \n-That same staff proceeded to order her lunch in front of us for 10minutes, go to another register! \n-The menu is way overpriced \n-The tacos lacked flavor ie tasted like white grandma tacos from Minnesota where she found the recipe from a 1979 issue of sunset mag\n- The presentation of the tacos- terrible. Just slapped down open face on a plate by that same grandma or from a prison kitchen \n- $8 mimosa on a Sunday, really?!\n- No brunch specials or items of any kind \n- $5 small iced toddy- that price is ridiculous \n- Music was barley playing and what was heard was not impressive \n-We just left and walked by a group of staff and no, thank you, see you later etc. \n\nUnderstanding the concept had to transition quickly but there should be no excuse for bad service and dirtiness. I don't see how anyone would can't to come here until they dramatically change things and get their act together. \n\n- peace, love n tacos \nm","10640":"Love this place, cool atmosphere and great food. I don't think there's anything on the menu that's not good. They also have a good beer list and drinks. The only bad thing is it can be a little pricey.","10641":"SideBar is the shizz.  I love the ambience, the bartenders are great, and the beer selection is not huge, but quality (although not on tap, so if you don't like bottles, don't come here).  I have nothing bad to say about this place.  It's the perfect small, mod bar.  I can show up in jeans and a tank top, or sequin covered minidress and feel equally comfortable.  I love their Gin Blossom, and Craig is pretty to look at and fun to talk to.  Never had a SideBar night end poorly.","10642":"Decent price for the area but I'd rather drive 20 minuets and pay the same at a much nicer course. No driving range. Every hole is lined by houses. Greens are in good shape.","10643":"Sitting at the bar and it smells as in stinks like a toilet.  We mention it to the bartender and he says that management is aware of it. Sorry I couldn't even finish my beer and of course the hooters wings got neglected. Sad case of a neglected facility so many other choices in Vegas make a better one than I did.","10644":"I love The Berkeley Cafe! For the many times I've been here, I have only ever had the Salmon Wrap because it is delicious! The wrap consists of a large piece of salmon, arugula, red onion, feta cheese, and tomatoes with sun-dried tomato aioli. It comes with a soup or salad - I always get the daily soup, and although it is always delicious, I find the soups tend to be a little salty for my taste. (But keep in mind, I am super picky about eating soups from restaurants as I am iffy about sodium content.) All this for - I think - $9? Totally worth it; definitely the best deal for lunch around.\n\nThe space is small though, so try to come here before or after the lunch hour rush. Or get your food to go! When it's nice out, there is a small patio open, which is nice. The waitresses here are super friendly :) \n\nWhen you eat here, you leave feeling good, not fat or bloated, which is a huge plus when you have to get through another half day of work.","10645":"Fabulous store layout and design. Beautiful merchandise.  Enjoy stopping by after lunch in the Forum Shoppes to drool! Great sales every now and then for all you locals who can stop by whenever.  Make friends with an employee and you'll be good to go!","10646":"Great indie music store and wonderful staff - they are really attentive and they make recommendations based on your taste if you're unsure on what to get . More than their personalized service that keeps me coming back, I can spend a whole day in here just listening to records as well.","10647":"Food is Ok but service needs improvements. The server messed up our order and when reminded just refused the fact that we ordered that particular item. Limited space inside restaurant and a better exhaust in kitchen would help.","10648":"I reallyyyy really wanted dessert after eating not the best dinner...and since we were back in the hotel at Paris I decided to stop by here.\n\nThe cashier lady was very nice and kind, but seemed to have a bit of trouble at the register.  I think maybe something was broken so it took a while for us just to get to order.\n\nI ordered the Napoleon crepe, lemon custard, berries, chantilly cream, nom nom nom! It was REALLY good, the tartness of the custard and lightly sweet thick chantilly cream worked well together.\n\nUnfortunately they don't fill all the way to the edge so the front tip of the triangle is filled while the back end is just crepe.  Is that how it's done in Paris?  I also feel like they were a bit too thick and eggy to be considered \"good\" crepes, but it was tasty nonetheless. I think the filling just sold me...\n\n$9.99 does seem expensive to me for a crepe since they are kind of cheap to make...but it is Vegas so got to expect everything to be expensive :P\n\nI MIGHT come back here again just for the Napoleon...if I'm ever in Vegas again...","10649":"They offer many different services here at Moneytree. Whether you need to cash a check, need a loan, etc. \n\nLove this Moneytree location in Henderson! A huge thank you to Cherise and Christian for always providing outstanding customer service during every visit. You guys are awesome! This is well ran branch.","10650":"A great concept. Golf thats not intimidating-- why didn't o think of This! Golf is fun, food is good, And the atmosphere is right. I especially like that they have plenty of cooling for this hot summer days.","10651":"Here for a work lunch, I was excited to finally get a chance to try Vintner Grill.\n\nWe arrived before the lunch crowd and were seated quickly. The restaurant is adorable and I enjoyed the table settings quite a bit. We started with bread service and everyone recommended the pretzel bread but I can never turn down olive bread so I went with that. \n\nI ordered the lunch portion of halibut and it was delicious. Superbly cooked and I could have easily devoured the full portion if I had ordered it. \n\nWhile I had attempted to eat relatively healthy for lunch, we decided to splurge for dessert and I couldn't say no trying all the options we ordered. We ordered the Turkish coffee cheesecake with pistachio gelato and honey, lemon & raspberry panna cotta and banana strudel. The cheesecake and panna cotta were the stars of the show. They were both so delicious and silky, I had to try my best to resist taking too many samples. \n\nOur lunch was great and the service lived up to our expectations as well. I look forward to coming back again soon for lunch and possibly to try their dinner options as well.","10652":"Came here twice during my trip to Montreal. Once just for dessert and the other time for lunch. I must say the desserts here are phenomenal and are worth 4.5 stars. The lunch, however, was a bit disappointing.\n\nThe night we came for dessert I ordered a chocolate shake and my friend ordered a s'mores hot chocolate. We also ordered fondue to share. Everything was tasty and phenomenal. Service was great as well.\n\nWhen we came back the following day for lunch, it was definitely a lackluster experience. Although the sandwiches we ordered were not terrible, they weren't great either. The sandwiches we got were on \"waffles\" (made from pizza dough). I really think the \"waffles\" ruined it for me.\n\nI highly recommend you just come here for dessert.","10653":"First off you get a huge portion of Roasted Pork, BBQ Pork, veggies and a whopping serving of rice.  Plus you get a side order of soup\/broth.  All this for $5.50. BEST DEAL IN TOWN!!!!  Honestly, you can get half and save the other half for later so really, it's like two meals for $2.75 per meal.\n\nThe decor looks awful and Im afraid to even go to their bathroon but who cares cause the food and the price is like from 1980.","10654":"Food isn't bad. The issue is that the place is so understaffed that waiting to order, and then waiting for it to be brought out is REALLY long.","10655":"Excellent staff, very helpful and very knowledgeable. Excellent selection of beers. Food was excellent and reasonably priced! Muscle bowls are the specialty.","10656":"This place is very little sushi and very much Peruvian and Brazilian. The menu for our flight was catered to the group. They said they were going to interview the table to see likes and dislikes... But, that didn't happen.\n\nHowever, the food courses blew us ALL away. We started off with a small plate of ceviche tacos that were the BEST I have ever had. Among other favorites: sea bass skewers, beef with truffles and some sort of dumpling plate. \n\nCan't wait to go back! Next time, we'll just tell them to shut up and take our money. The flight course is quoted at 40-50 per person. We ended up with a check that was bigger than that (about 70 each - but some of us had drinks). If you are staying at the Palazzo this is a must visit!","10657":"Yup its in the end of a a strip mall maybe one of the last strip malls in this area of Independence Blvd. but don't let that stop you from checking out this gem. If you want a real sub...real service...and some hot and delicious chicken and wild rice soup check out Chris'. \n\nThis place rocks when it comes to consistency I frequent here often for lunch..you can always get a seat and the waiters are friendly. You can order your sub hot or cold on all different types of breads or rolls (onion roll highly recommended). Deli meat is cut fresh big PLUS. Don't forget to ask for the horseradish mustard it is amazing.","10658":"The food here is tasty. Lots of flavour. Didn't really know what to order as I did not know any of the main entree. \n\nBut lucky there is a catch all menu item called meat combination. Well, we were here to try their dishes so meat combination sounds right. It was delicious but be hungry. The meat combination for 2 can really serve 4. \n\nI recommend this place if you wanna try authentic Ethiopian food. Not that I know what authentic Ethiopian food is but the place felt and food tasted authentic.","10659":"First night here with my family and we are loving everything! The mini snack bar has crazy prices but it was so tempting that we ended up having a couple overpriced drinks. The beds were so comfortable!! I love how all the lights, have the dim option. We had the view facing the arena on the 6th floor. He staff is very friendly. Just expect to pay $23 for parking or $30 for valet. We will definitely be coming back!!","10660":"I have tried many services in Charlotte where I am paying 30-40 an hour to get my house dusted , vacuumed and the occasional toilet paper art. Two hours cost me 90 and then I had to clean the other 2000 square feet of my house, \n    Today that changed Robert came to me from Homejoy and cleaned my house, he mopped my floors with an actual mop something I have been begging cleaners here to do for years. Scrubbed my bathrooms and kitchen, wiped down the baseboards, sucked up 100 lbs of dog fur and actual cleaned my house, he didn't tidy it up he cleaned it. As a man he is also able to move furniture clean under it, \n    I can dust and sweep in between visits but when I pay some to clean I want it clean and now that I have found Robert, I know that my house will be clean\n\nHowever my rating of Homejoy as a company is terrible. A start up that exploits local people desperate for working taking half the hourly rate for themselves, providing no supplies, no training and no vacuum etc. Each cleaner is an independent contractor, corp talk for 1099 no taxes paid, no insurance, no workman's comp etc. They set up a server and a regional coach hire anyone out of craigslist and send them out to clean your house. The business itself adds nothing to local economy or area, it is a shark tank winner and was gifted 38 million by Google.\nWould I use them again NEVER would I use the indie contractor they sent yes and I would pay him a decent fair wage","10661":"Worst customer service and horrible quality I've never had my nails look so bad and that's besides the fact that he nipped my skin about 6 times hurt so badly and would just keep going NEVER WILL I RETURN","10662":"I went to the Morpheus Clinic a while back and after a short conversation, was told that I was not hypnotizable.  \n\nHypnotizability is seen as an ability, and not having it appears to be a handicap.\n\nHypnotists who think like this are behind the times, and need to go back to hypnotism school.","10663":"One of the best car rental centers I've been to. \n\nThe bus to and from the airport is ok, but once you're here, the place is huge, and well organized.\n\nIf you need to rent a car in Las Vegas, you'll almost certainly need to come here to get it. I don't think you'll be disappointed. Just be patient if it's busy. It wasn't when we were there, but I'm sure it can be...","10664":"I wait for 15 mins for a latte. Many people got the drinks before me even if they ordered much later. Is there any order? I don't think the people respect customers.","10665":"Agent gave me a \"free\" upgrade but charged me later. Unable to resolve with cc company and no live agent. Will NOT be using Budget ever again.","10666":"Mixed feelings about this place. We ordered a recliner about 10 or so years ago. It still works perfectly well and has really held up - no sagging, all mechanicals working properly. I gave it to my children when they moved out as I want a power recliner and that one had the bar on the side. They had a 30% off power and leather sale recently. Since the chair I wanted now was both power and leather, I went in to see if I could get what I wanted. The power chairs with the different motors for adjusting lumbar and head as well as legs and back are wonderful and this is the only place I know that has those options. But you will pay dearly for that comfort. The chair I ended up with was over $2000, tax and delivery included, even with the 30% off sale! I'm waiting for it to be delivered because it is semi-custom but I anticipate it being comfortable. However, the reasons for the lesser star rating is some of their wacky policies. Since this is a chair, we were going to save money ($70) by picking it up in my husband's truck. If you go that route, they will still charge you $39 to have it delivered to the store. What? Why? That is ridiculous. When you discuss (argue) these silly policies, they pretty much just shrug their shoulders and say \"company policy\" as if they have absolutely no control - and maybe they don't. Because they are corporate owned now (changed over two years ago according to store manager), they will not (cannot?) negotiate costs for anything. I asked if they had a warehouse where we could pick it up for free. No. Also, even if I paid the $39 and picked it up myself, I'd have to sign off on it (after inspecting it in the store). If I bring it home and put it together myself and then have a problem, I'm out of luck since I signed off that it was perfectly fine. Um no, not doing that so I paid the money for delivery. Very bad business practice and nothing to be done about it!  The next reason for the lower star rating is their policy for custom orders. Their pricing policies are really arcane! I really wanted a bright red leather for my new chair and they offered it in a lower grade leather than the standard one on the chair I ordered. But even though it was a lower grade leather, it wasn't an included leather option for this chair so the custom price was $500 more for a lesser quality leather. Huh? They really make it almost impossible to make your order custom without paying through the nose (which I'm already doing - $2000 for a CHAIR?)!  Apparently there's a set of fabrics\/leathers for each model chair that you can choose as semi-custom for that chair without changing the price much. But go outside that standard set and you're going to pay A LOT for the privilege. I decided on the wine colored red that didn't cost me any more money. Definitely NOT what I wanted but acceptable. The staff was friendly. Because they don't work on commission, they don't hassle you but they also aren't running to meet you at the door to help you out. Overall, I'm hoping I'll be happy with this purchase because I'll be able to make adjustments to my chair to make it most comfortable for me but I'm paying a lot for that and not getting everything that I wanted. Hence my mixed feelings and 3 stars instead of 5.","10667":"The place itself is nice, service OK. Their garlic knots are pretty good but pasta not and pizza blah. I find their food dry and tasteless. The only was I would choose their food is if it was for free and even then that is a maybe.","10668":"Disclaimer: This was part of my Buffet of Buffets package. I used it here for a late lunch. Of the three I attended (also Spice Market at Planet Hollywood  and the Paris Le Village), this was least impressive. It still wasn't, like, bad, especially for the overall value. But given a choice I wouldn't prioritize Flavors.\n\nThat being said, they had a lot of shrimp, and the buffet includes (regular) beverages, which is a secret value here and at Spice Market. They had a pretty decent chicken tortilla soup and a chicken cordon bleu that wasn't bad. I also really liked their nacho cheese and chips, oddly! Some of the otber food offerings looked a little \"tired\" when I was there, and their salad bar was minimal compared to others. Overall, it was kind of Meh. With one exception:\n\nThe desserts!! They had ice cream, lots of sauce options, a mix of cupcakes, cookies, brownies, bars and...CANNOLI! They were fantastic! I may or may not have had 4 of them...the dessert section alone might have pushed my rating up to a 4, but everything else was just so average.","10669":"My husband and I were looking for a great place to get some meatball heros. My husband is from New York.  \n\nCheesecake is awesome, save your self some money on cheesecake. For go cheesecake factory (across the way from stage deli) and get some great cheesecake from here.","10670":"So, once upon a time I fancied myself a rocker. I had the requisite black hair in jr high school, the ripped t-shirts, etc. I outgrew the phase like most people do, grew out my hair , started easing up on the teen angst. But deep inside I believed that I could still hold my own, so that if I walked into a punk show I could still rock out with the best of them. Thanks to the Distillery, I now know that is a lie. I am not even close to hardcore, and I never ever was. I'm at peace with this.\n\nWe were heading somewhere completely different but walked by when someone suggested we go in. For some reason I did, and  due to a mis-communication half of us had paid to get in while half refused to go in and left. Those that wouldn't actually ARE more hard core, and that speaks to how the rest of the night went. The people were fairly rude, jostling everybody and giving the outsiders dirty looks. Definitely a hard crowd. Everyone looked like they'd stepped off the cover of a Rancid album. Lots of scowls. They had a tiny circle pit, as everyone was too busy affecting coolness to join in. The band was awful and the cover overpriced considering. We finished our beers and left to rejoin with the smarter group. \n\nYep, not hardcore at all! Phew, close call!","10671":"Mountain's Edge has been described as one of the fastest growing master planned communities in all of the United States taking over that ranking from the Summerlin community. It's about 17 minutes via surface street to 215 beltway to I-15 highway to the Las Vegas Strip. There are several service and dining options finally opening up around the area, though a few are still closed or not being developed due to the surrounding economy. What makes this community very different is that it stays true to its name by actually being near a Mountain's Edge. The Mountain's Edge park that is close by, has a mountain of sorts that you can climb and see a lot of the surrounding valley. A good place for people to exercise, climb and take the family.","10672":"My first time here and I love it! BEN was amazing!! I had a ingrown nail and within seconds he removed it. Very cute place, clean, and everyone is very polite! This is my new nail place","10673":"This is a great place to purchase a freshly made burger and a traditional malt or shake.\n\nAmbience: Very clean and personal touch with escorted seating. They also use real flatware instead of plastic, big time plus. Paper towel rolls instead napkins makes for easy clean-up and those people that love to ask for extra napkins. Overall a nice blend of happy days diner meet modern world. One large television is mounted upon the wall however; was not turned on ( great because once I had my lunch companion put the cell phone down we were able to have a great conversation.) This is the perfect place with a moderate crowd to grab an upscale burger without an upscale price.\n\nFood: The burger was very tasty and reminded me of the perfect cheese burger that I ate while I was in Japan. The \"best of both\" was tasty however the onion rings were cut so thin that they reminded me of string fries in a bad way (-). The smallest burger that I would suggest is the semi-serious (highlighted on the menu) as the $1 difference is a noticeable upgrade. I had a hard time finding my classic burger underneath the bun. The picture displayed is the semi-serious burger. The hamburger buns are toasted with butter and made me smile while I jumped up and down. Fountain soda had a good mix and I guess that the price is okay since you get a free re-fill. Other items on the menu wings, shakes, malts, and salads were not sampled. Good nitch as they stayed true to the product \"cheese burgers\". Fair warning $$ and the burger free toppings have a great selection from lettuce to tomatoes however; the premium toppings such as bacon (.99) and mushrooms(.99) cost extra. My bill was approximately $24 for 2 burgers (classic w\/free toppings and the semi w\/bacon and mushrooms), 1 medium onion ring and french fry combo (able to split between us), 1 fountain drink with free refill, and one glass of water with refill, ouch.\n\nCustomer Service was great with frequent inquiries from all of the floor servers \"great concept and job\" (+). Bill was not presented until requested (+) gave me  time to think about other menu items and enjoy the personal service (the reason that you go to have a sit down meal).\n\nThis is the first 30-60 days that this place has been opened and I am curious if they can hold the line when they really get busy in the next few months and the summer crowd.","10674":"Delish! Party of four dine in. All different food all yummy. Curry Puffs and satay are a must.","10675":"Who'd have thought that in a part of the country where basements are nonexistent, there's a fantastic restaurant that's entirely underground? Salt Cellar has always been my favorite place for sea food in the valley. The quality of the fish is always good and fresh, especially when you consider that Arizona is a landlocked state. \n\nMy girlfriend and I had a wonderful Valentine's Day dinner at the Salt Cellar. She can't eat shell fish, which eliminates a lot of the items on the menu, but there's plenty of good options to pick from. We split a Halibut ceviche appetizer, which may have been the best ceviche I've ever had. Nothing against shrimp, but the Halibut is much more flavorful. I had Swordfish with mango salsa. The mango salsa was unreal. They left everything cut in big chunks, which was a little shocking at first, but it covered the whole fish, and was quite tasty. The fish itself tasted a little dry to me at first, but as I got to the center, I found that it was perfectly cooked, and the salsa continued to enhance the flavor. My girlfriend had Mahi. I tried a bite, and it was also delicious. \n\nEntrees are around the prices you'd expect to pay at this type of establishment. But orders come with a salad, vegetables, and choice of potato or rice. Two glasses of wine, an appetizer, and two entrees cost a little more than $100 (not including tip). Not bad for a special occasion. \n\nThe place is very small (be prepared to be seated a little too close to the party next to) so reservations are a must. For parties of two, you can make them on Salt Cellar's website. They only thing I think Salt cellar needs is an update. While the dim lighting, wood and nautical theme is cool. The walls and art hanging on them walk a fine line between out of date and nostalgic.","10676":"This is one of the few comics who kept me laughing throughout the show. He is a bundle of energy & smiles. I've seen a lot of comedy routines in the Atlanta area & a few in Vegas, & this is the one I recommend. I got one of his DVDs as well!","10677":"I feel compelled to update everyone on the new dealership. I know things change and that's part of life but not always for the better. I paid a lot for an extended warranty but I cant get a call back from the service department to check to see if what I want fixed is covered, I was assured by sales that it would be only to be transferred to service and find out \"Well, we need to look at it first\" That would be understandable but I explained exactly what needed to be done and in detail. I do know and did repair my own vehicles for years. Still, its a long way there and I have to devote an entire day to get it done. I wish they could just look up my warranty info and say yes that's covered or no its not based on the information I give them.","10678":"I never knew thee was a restaurant that was Chinese, Jamaican and Indian fusion food!! This place was definitely best of all worlds. I went here last night w my bf and some friends and we for our own closed off booth with the a curtain which I love! It made it seem very intimate dining experience. What was also great is the button system where if you need anything like water, food, etc. you just need to push the button in the wall for service which is a neat feature. The price is amazing considering the size of all the food we  got and having major amount of leftovers. This place is definitely worth a trip to scarb!! Fave was the ginger beef on the menue!!","10679":"By far one of the best Thai restaurants in the area yet!! It's right up there with Nicky's Thai on the Northside!! Tom Kha soup on point and Pad Thai best I've ever had, the noodles were actually made correctly. Great service and good atmosphere. If you haven't been, what are you waiting for?!?!","10680":"After reading all if the reviews I had high hopes for this place, and they didn't disappoint. We started with a house salad and Miso soup accompanied by the Spicy octopus salad. These 3 dishes were honestly under-whelming. The Miso soup was plain and uninspired as were both salads. Once this course was over everything got much better. The Salmon Tartar was fantastic...spicy and rich with great textures served with rice cakes. This was followed by an assortment of sashimi and rolls that are the basics that you would expect from a high end sushi restaurant. The final course had 2 specialty rolls including a lobster roll and a strawberry-scallop-shrimp roll. The 2nd roll was exceptional in its sweet mixture of flavours. All in all well worth the time and money.","10681":"Excellent pizza. We went in a large group and were able to sample many menu items. The Goat Cheese and Shrimp pizza were the best. Probably can't go wrong with any of them.","10682":"Found the store through google and went there and wanted advice on what I should fee the dog as far as healthy food goes and he was happy to help me.  Had the dog try it before I bought it and the dog loved it.  He also was nice enough to carry the food to the car for me.","10683":"I really wanted to like this place, but was disappointed and probably won't go back.\n\nFOOD:\nI had the boar sausage and he had the risotto.  We also had salads to start.  First off, the salads were hard to eat as the stems of the leaves had not been removed and they impeded the enjoyment of the starter.  Also, it was rather bland.  The main courses were over-salted.  My boar sausage was disappointingly lack-luster when it came to flavour.  The risotto was over-cooked, but other than the salt, it wasn't bad.\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nYes, this restaurant is pretty.\n\nSERVICE:\nThey accommodated us even though we did not have a reservation.  It seemed like they just tucked us in and hoped the reserved party would come in late.  It worked perfectly for us as we finished up quickly.\n\nVALUE:\nSince we were disappointed with our meal, the restaurant was over-priced for what we experienced.","10684":"I usually get my boba elsewhere but my parents stopped inside to buy some groceries. My sister and I decided to try the Mango Green Tea with Lychee Jelly (OMG BOMB). And to our surprise, they actually use real fruit in their drinks! This is one of the only places I've been that uses actual fruit and not just powder. I ordered the Mango Strawberry Smoothie with Boba and it was amazing as well. If you're sweet tooth, pretty much everything on their menu is perfect for you. They also have a selection of shaved ice and snow which I have to try out as well. Definitely recommend this place!\n\nSOOO I love this place but found a piece of metal in my drink. I'm sure it was an accident but still..","10685":"The food here is absolutely amazing.  It hasn't been busy either time that I came, but for the price and the serving size, I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for something out of the ordinary and truly unique.  The inside has a great atmosphere complemented with music videos of artists from all over the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Northern Africa.  Definitely check this place out!","10686":"I didn't think that this was going to be all of that special and I can say that I pretty much went to appease my wife. Sure, I was a little curious, but it was 99% to not start a fight. Well, I was pleasantly surprised! This is actually pretty awesome. It's free and after 8pm it's every 15 minutes so the wait didn't bother me in the least. If you're on the strip after nightfall you should definitely check it out.","10687":"Very decently priced place. They didn't have shish tawook or chicken breast on their menu so I was forced to go to Ali baba down the road for my fiance which was a disaster piece of food compared to Wrap and Grab's chicken shawarma. I've been here a few times they are pretty good in timeliness and service and their food is above average as well. I've seen the same people working here over the one or two visits over 3 years.","10688":"Service was meh - now mind you, it was during the Phoenix Film Festival, but the Festival is 2 weeks, so management could have staffed better.\n\nAlso, the Food was bland and texture was off.  I always clean my plate.  Not this time.  Might be back, to try again, but with all the options nearby prob not.\n\nThe restaurant was clean, and the layout was good.","10689":"Honestly the best hamburgers in town! The sweet potato French fries are excellent! It's awesome to be able to see them cooking your fresh made to order food! There's always fresh variety of toppings to choose from and you can put on whatever you want! Soft drinks have unlimited refills with a great selection. If you have room for the desert, I recommend the brownie!! The music is always such an awesome selection! The people who work here are so happy and friendly, something that should be a staple in every restaurant.","10690":"A newcomer to Penn Hills, and thankfully so.  Morgan's closed in January 2012, and now Rey Azteca has moved to Monroeville. It seems as if Penn Hills loses a restaurant each month. \n\nTsuki now resides where Rey Azteca once was, on Frankstown Road.  I ventured in on a weekday during lunch hour for some takeout.  My first thought? COPS. Lots of em'.  So don't go here for lunch if you have a rap sheet in Penn Hills. \n\nI selected a rainbow roll with a side of clear soup and I picked out a salmon bento box for my mother.  While I was waiting, the extremely friendly waitstaff offered me a free pot of green tea. \n\nThe clear soup was very delicious, and not too salty. My rainbow roll was not the best I've ever had, but still fresh and sufficiently tasty. Mom LOVED her bento box, which was a steal for the price. It had salmon, a few California rolls, an egg roll, and vegetables. \n\nOverall a decent Japanese restaurant. I've had better sushi, but for the price and service, I am still happy to give Tsuki four stars.","10691":"For some reason, I liked the place better before the overhaul. It used to have a home-y feel and the previous waitress was a lot friendlier and more attentive. Ever since the change, they have been messing up my take-out orders and I just don't enjoy the experience as much anymore. It's convenient for lunch because it is close to my work but it is also extremely over-priced. $11+tax for a portion of perogies (and they forgot the sour cream) is not reasonable in my opinion. Probably won't be returning for a while, if ever.","10692":"this is by far the best buffet ive ever been to. we went on a friday night, the line was crazy long but they let us sit at the bar which was great!\n\nthe staff at the bar was super friendly.\n\nand now onto the good stuff, the food! \n\nbeef wellington, prime rib, elk, ostrich, creamed spinach and other yummy veggies and the desserts were killer! i ate enough creme brulee for 3 people. my only gripe, no tiramisu! but plently of other things to fill in that gap so they still score 5 stars with me!","10693":"Went there before Rally in the Alley, which is sponsored by Main Street, and had great quick snack.  I have been there several times and the story is the same.  There is great service and great food.  The menu has a nice selection of entrees, salads & apps.  Prices tend to be on the higher side, but i have no problem with this since it keeps the riff raff out.  They can eat at Denny's.  There is a downstairs bar that will have live entertainment and another full bar upstairs in the back.","10694":"St. James's Gate has a good selection of food and beer for the area. It's one of the better restaurants right around Islington station. However, I feel as though the food isn't cooked on site, because it seemed like my pot pie had been frozen and then microwaved. \n\nOn Fridays and Saturdays, there's generally live music. On some nights, a crowd that seems more fit for the Entertainment District than an Irish pub in the West end gathers there.","10695":"I stumbled across this quaint nail salon  in desperate search of a mani\/pedi and was amazingly surprised. Super cute boutique style nail shop with an airy beach aura, I immediately fell in love! I was greeted as soon as I walked through the door unlike many of the nail salons in the area. Another highlight was that the staff was engaged with clientele! A big hit was them speaking English in front of the clients and not just  speaking over you as if you're not there or talking about you while servicing you. Drinks and snacks are complimentary which they offer to all guest. My experience was A+!!! The best part is my nails look amazing...I'll definitely be back! Awesome service!!!","10696":"A fall from grace. \n\nBattista's has been an institution in Las Vegas for decades. Unfortunately, it simply does not live up to its reputation. The servers are tired in their appearance and their attitude. The reheated entrees bring you back to T.V. dinners on a tray. The lingering after taste of onion and garlic powder stains my tongue 4 hours post dinner. \n\nDespite this it has a uniquely Vegas charm. The goofy objects, menus, and posters on the walls come of a genuinely quirky and not played up. The hostess was proud of her duty to adorn the entrance with her smile.  The house wine - still lovely - so is the mood lighting.\n\nI would go back for drinks. Maybe some calamari. Definitely no entrees.","10697":"Went for lunch on a Wednesday. Had the hot and sour soup which was good. It had a little zip to it and a bit of thick consistency which is how I like it. BBQ pork fried rice was tasty. Service was quick and efficient. Also, they have a baccarat section right outside...probably not a coincidence it's in front of Noodle Asia.","10698":"Shaina was flawless! Super friendly and made sure I got exactly what I wanted out of my eyebrows. Pink Cherry Wax was a cute and clean store, and I'll definitely be going there again!","10699":"This is my second visit to Tom's urban. I really enjoy this place for breakfast\/lunch. Great food and selection, outdoor heated\/misted seating. The grits are to die for, prices are just right and...Bottomless Mimosas.  Also great selection for vegetarians. \nI hit in my book and I will return next time I am in Vegas.","10700":"Look at the unit you will be moving into not the model prior to signing anything. Broke my lease early only after acouple months due to an ongoing roach problem. Management insisted multiple foggings would resolve the issue but they kept coming back. Instead of moving out I tried to see about Management moving me to another unit but they would not work with me whatsoever. At one point, I came home after a fogging and maintenance had moved literally everything around (i'm talking the big appliances) without bothering to put anything back. Sure I get everything has to be moved and theres a waiting period but I found it extremely disrespectful that no one thought about returning after the waiting period to out back the heavy items. The appliances had been lifted a pretty significant distance from the wall and dealing with lower back issues moving it back alone was rough. I eventually got tired of waking up with at least one roach crawling across my face every night - I kid you not. It even got to the point where roaches didn't even bother hiding during the day. They would come out of the ac vents, the sink, the closet, and any dark space out of reach. The roaches have quite the life though. They get to live there for FREE. \n\nDocumented everything which also included my intent to break my lease due to the inability to remediate a serious health issue. Manager tried telling me that I was not going to get out of the lease break amount. Of course they sent me to collections, not sure if my documentation sent to the collections agency or the Property managements company's lack of response helped me win my dispute but I managed to get the collection removed. Oh and don't negotiate whatsoever with the colonnade. I felt like the collections reps were more helpful than the staff that work up in corporate. Crazy right?\n\nCheck out the pics. Not only was I dealing with roaches when all the drawers got pulled back there was crap left by the other tenant that the cleaning team missed.","10701":"I came here recently for lunch and thought I had walked in on a dinner theater production, or an episode of Seinfeld.\n\nI was standing in line when the owner started yelling at a customer.  At first, I thought they knew each other, but soon I realized it wasn't an act.  To make matters interesting, he then decided not to honor anothers Blimpie card -- because it was stamped from another location: \"I get nothing from this!\"  \"Go away!\"  I guess there was no sandwich for him, or soup!\n\nDuring these outbursts, some of the customers walked out in confusion.  I just took my sub and left. \n\nIn contrast, the employees all seem very nice and friendly.  But, I'll take a pass in the future and skip the drama. \n\nSorry!","10702":"I'm honestly confused. I don't understand how this place has 4 stars. The ingredients were very fresh, which I was very happy about. However, completely flavorless. I ordered the chicken naked burrito. The guacamole didn't taste like much, rice was bland, chicken lacked flavor. Very disappointing :(","10703":"I went back and tried again.  All the food in the freezer was fresh with 6+ month expiration dates.  Bought a big bag and my doggy loves it.  What my doggy loves, I also love.","10704":"Hands down the best Noodle spot in the east valley, enough said!!","10705":"When  I return to Scottsdale I  really enjoy returning to Cien Agaves. The atmosphere is fun and vibrant. The waitresses are all hot. They have a great deal on  taco Tuesdays. They have a wide selection of drinks. I really enjoy the blackberry mojito and the perfectly Arizonan yet exotic prickly pear margarita.\n\nThe service is quick and you get chips and salsa before the meal. It's a great place to  meet friends and have a  pleasant evening when you are in Old Town Scottsdale.","10706":"I've been here quite a few times, I find it to be very mediocre. Food isn't bad but nothing fantastic either. It's a good go-to spot for cheap pitchers (of PBR to be specific). They have awesome choices for tasty drinks, $2.50 shooters as well but they're at that price for a reason. Service is friendly too. All in all, average resto\/bar.","10707":"So finally I found a good Indian food place in Charlotte. Tried Hyderabadi style biryani and sheekh kebab. ... but the best part was the pudina (mint) chutney which was actually made of mint and not just coriander and onions. ... however a word of caution to all my American friends who are not used to spicy food: Make sure you tell the server to tone it down :p","10708":"I really like this hospital ,they been helpful to me and made me feel better ,staff is really good and knowledgeable as well. Love my nurses. Building is well maintained they have nice coffee shop on a first  floor ,big parking lot and complimentary Vallet to. Thanks guys for what you did for me.","10709":"Tried the red bean and matcha wheel cakes. They were a let down, especially after reading the good reviews on them. They were pretty bland despite the generous filling. Definitely not worth $2.80 each.\n\nThe original milk tea with tapioca and grass jelly was tasty. Even at 25% sugar it was quite sweet so I can't imagine how sweet 100% would be.\n\nNothing special.","10710":"So despite my limited hairline, I decided that I want to try and go a step up from the normal First Choice\/Magicuts\/Chinese barbers who charge between $8 to $15.  \n\nAs I was walking to work, I saw a sign saying \"Men's Haircuts by Jenny - $18\".  On that same day, as I was leaving work, I said to myself \"meh, might as well get a haircut since I'm not totally happy with what I got last time\". \n\nThe service was impeccable.  I asked them to do the sides really short, but leave the upper half slightly longer. She literally spent 5 minutes asking \"is this okay?\" and I kept on saying shorter.    At the end, the sides were layered perfectly and she brushed off all the residual hair perfectly.  \n\nAll in all, great service.","10711":"First visit was quite helpful. I was given a free sample of some soap to help with a skin reaction. It worked great so I returned to purchase an entire bar but did not know what the name of the soap was. I asked the same lady that helped me earlier and she didn't take any time to get more details of my visit only to tell me she didn't remember and hurried off leaving me to myself to try and figure it out. I am furious! I drove over an hour to come back for that and this is the treatment I get?! A precious little black lady came over and listened and led me to the product she felt I was talking about and it was indeed what I had used.  When I took it to the counter to pay the nasty attitude white lady all of a sudden had time to talk and remembered me now. At this point I find it insulting even more that I am only important when I have money in my hand. I will order from the soap company directly from now on. I won't be back.","10712":"I love Costco.  And as far as I'm concerned this one is the best there is that I have been too.  \nI shop here for my family and for my business.  The staff is always friendly and get you in out quickly.\nThey also have a great selection of some high end products; plus they carry a large selection of Organic.\nI brought a beautiful watch there the other day.  And if you don't know it already Costco has the best return policy on the planet.","10713":"Best chicken and waffles ever.... The chicken was very flavorful absolutely divine, the waffle was delicious and the watermelon a savory addition to the plate ...The cornbread was right on point..yum. The service was outstanding and the ambience was classic! Good cocktails and wine list. A little bit pricey but definitely worth it...Highly recommended if in Las Vegas area...","10714":"Came here on a date and had the Chef's 5 course tasting menu from Executive Chef Jamilka Borges! Phenomenal! My date is a meat-eater and I am vegetarian and she thought of the most incredible dishes for me. \nI started with a fried tofu with grilled pineapple, raisin chutney, parsley and topped with a quail egg. The tofu was perfectly cooked and the raisins and pineapple gave it a sweet taste.\nThe next course was frisee, radishes, avacado, edible flowers in a kohlrabi puree. It was a cooler, more refreshing dish that was very light.\nThe third was a manicotti with house-made pasta, a rich cream sauce, with asparagus and pea shoots. A warmer and thicker dish in contrast to the previous dish. The pasta was perfect, soft with a slight tougher chew. A little softer than al dente which was good for manicotti. \nThe fourth, which was my main entree, was a completely unbelievable polenta! Seasoned with just the right amount of salt, it was the perfect consistency. I have never had a better polenta in my life. Had snow peas, a fried egg, asparagus and eggplant.\nWe finished off with a dessert from the pastry chef, had bananas, sorbet and cream puffs and chocolate souffle. \n\nOverall, it was fantastic. I can't wait to come back!","10715":"I always go to Priya for my haircuts and she always listens and doesn't cut anything too short (or not short enough, which I found to be the problem with Toni and Guy).  Nice, clean space.  Last time I was there the receptionist asked me if I wanted a drink, and I said (panting) that I wanted water, but it wasn't until 15 minutes later when Priya came to fetch me that I was brought any drink.  I'd say in the future they shouldn't ask until they are ready to bring it to you.  Prices are reasonable but a little expensive.","10716":"This organization was willing and able to take in a stray cat from my area when no one else had \"room at the inn\"  I had been feeding this little stray and had become very attached to it but could not adopt it. The lady that came to my house to pick up the stray was very sweet and caring.  I could tell she truly had a heart for animals.  I was so grateful that they were able to take it in this cat and care for it.  They are now looking for a home for this cat.  I will never forget how kind and caring they were.","10717":"Truly an old school diner. The staff are extremely helpful and personable. The owner is fairly new but seems to really have to operations down pat. I look forward to dining again.","10718":"I made reservations for a group of 15 through OpenTable and it was the easiest reservation I made for the trip.  The decor is nice and the location convenient.\n\nMy food was completely blah.  I had the fried macaroni appetizer which was absolutely tasteless and a side caesar salad which I did not care for.  My fiance and I split the Gummy Bear dry ice cocktail.  It was tasty but half of the goblet was full of ice, which I wasn't expecting for a $36 drink.\n\nIt was okay, but there are far, far better places to eat\/drink on the strip.","10719":"Although a bit overpriced the food itself is pretty flavorful. I didn't care for the burrito I got thought it lacked flavor but I did really enjoy the chicken tacos. Nice that is comes with guacamole without an additional charge. Also had the chicken nachos. Only thing I didn't care about that is they just sprinkle shredded cheese & warm it up. Thought they could have done better with the cheese but when everything else was added on the nachos it was quite flavorful. I like the carne asada & chicken. Horchata taste like cupcakes to me lol.","10720":"Always kind and polite. Organic products and excellent service at Nancy's! I love them. They treated me like a queen for my wedding prep too!","10721":"My family has bought 3 dogs from this location over the last 19 years. All American eskimos. None sick. No issues. Pricey though. One we had for 15 years. One for 14. And one we still have.","10722":"Patogh closed down, Darband is too far, Shomal rice makes me cry and Banu is contemporary. If it wasn't for a nice friend, I'd keep driving by Shater Abbas, to never discover their great khoresht and kabob. \n\nThe place is best suitable for a quick dine-and-go or take-out, as it is small and isn't exactly cozy. Muted colours, modern furniture, very clean and well-maintained. \n\nI've been spoiled rotten with great homemade Persian food so if I don't like your rice, I really don't care how famous your Ghormeh Sabzi is (which I am also terribly picky about because it's my least favourite dish but when prepared right, it's a star). Their rice is closest to what I've actually loved in a while. Soltani kabob melts in your mouth and it's far superior to their koobideh. Baghali polo is very aromatic and a single portion is quite generous, you may not be able to handle it with an appetizer. My all-time favourite Fesenjan was quite close to being well-balanced, if it didn't end up on an oilier side, much like the Ghormeh Sabzi. Both dishes had plenty of flavour to make up for it. \n\n\nNot a place to get comfortable at, but a great idea to stop by for a quick meal with friends. An ideal dish to split in a rush would be their appetizer trio of your favourite dips and picklings. It's enormous and bread is fresh. Service is prompt and friendly, foreigner or not. Take-out service is very speedy, regardless of how busy they are. \n\nI travel all the way from Lakeshore for my takeout! Gives me an excuse to complete my Persian dining experience by grabbing pastry from Heloo Goolub and groceries at Parsian Fine Foods. Those 3 businesses make that plaza a great one.","10723":"These guy are amazing, the breakfast burritos with ham and everything are awesome. I have been here at all hours; In my pajamas on Inauguration Day , after work and on my way to work. They never fail, give these guys a try, they're nice too and deserve a tip.\n\nOne thing: If you add a tip to your receipt they do not process it, so take a buck in with you.","10724":"It is such a pleasure to be a customer when the owner and staff make you feel wanted and welcome, vs wanting your money!  Each time I call to place a takeaway order and each time I visit makes me smile because I know the other person is smiling too.  The pizza itself is delicious and fresh and boasts a crust that is chewy and crisp (how is that possible?); everything tastes just as good the next day.  Prices are competitive with other pizza joints around town -- a large pizza is $19.99 and is sliced into 8 big pieces -- but you may get MORE for your money here, due to the wonderful customer service included in every order.","10725":"If you're in the mood for a tasty frank...try out JJ's. I went after the lunch crowd and was thoroughly pleased...plus I got a free side order of tater tots. That makes me happy! Lol","10726":"This location is very busy and they do a great job of managing the line. There is not a lot of seating when it gets busy, so prepare to do some standing during the busy periods.\n\nI had the Mangonada, and although the mangos were fresh, the flavor combination was a huge turn off for me. What redeemed this place was the coffee horchata! I highly recommend it. It may not look like the best drink on the menu but this is by far my favorite.\n\nTotal wait time: 1 hour 15 min \n\nDrink total: 3 drinks","10727":"Its a Dive yes, however I love it there. Once every few months I go there. The food is pretty good and members get free or half off diner coupons. The budget loves that. I found the workers friendly, I have been going there for many years. There is a non smoking area that is just that!!!","10728":"Nothing fancy here. They seem to carry the bare minimum of everything; guns, accessories, cleaning supplies and ammo. I am sure if you ask, they could special order whatever you were in the market for. Prices were a little on the high side I felt. \n\nThe staff is knowledgeable, but not very friendly. I have been there several times and have yet to see any of the guys smile. \n\nThe range is decent. I sense this is what keeps the place in business. 8 stalls. Fairly clean. You are expected to sweep up your own casings. There are shot up cardboard targets available for free for you to attach your own paper targets to. Cost, including tax, was $16.01.","10729":"This place has awesome authentic street Mexican food. The location is perfect and the atmosphere inside is great for conversation and they have bands and happy hours as well.","10730":"Fast, reliable, affordable. Rick the owner is very professional and makes sure I'm always satisfied. He has done several of my properties and always makes them look like new.","10731":"We LOVE this place!!   The moment you pull in to the parking lot, you know it's going to be special.   Every single person working here is trying to make your experience the very best.  The Host\/Hostess, the people who seat you, the Servers, management. \nYesterday,  we had a delicious meal, the \"falling off the bones\" ribs and all of the extras.  Karly, Michael, Sydney were all very attentive.   Our beverages were constantly refilled,  without asking.  They were extremely friendly.   We spoke with the Service Manager, Megan, who was also VERY sweet.  We love this place.  It's very popular,  and because of this, there are often wait times.  It's well worth waiting.   They are very efficient so it isn't too long to be seated.","10732":"Slow service and more expensive then the usual sushi spot.  Lots of people waiting on their dinner and no waitress in sight!   More expensive to eat in then take out.","10733":"Great food & drinks, great atmosphere! This place is hands down one of my favorite places to go. Service is always exceptional also. Our server Jimmy was very personable and knowledgeable on the menu, answering any questions we had while having a few laughs as well. Highly recommend this restaurant!","10734":"Delicious we had spicy Hirame  spicy yellowtail sashimi plate.  We reorder them.  \nWe also tried Kali bowl tender rib meat with a sweet tangy sauce.  Family owned.","10735":"Only way we could post is give it one star, nothing better than 4 kids playing grab ass. Some of the veggies were empty, said to wait they were getting more.Place was filthy, no clean up anywhere. Place is new with no management. We have pizza at other papa Murphy's stores,always been good. Will not go back and I live here! Go to the Craig st location, run excellent and the pizza was right on. Good luck","10736":"Sadly disappointed based on the Yelp reviews I read. In Charlotte for the summer and decided to try when my girlfriend came into town. Did brunch on Sunday afternoon. We arrive, restaurant is half empty and are sat immediately. Sitting there, just sitting there. Hostess realizes we could use water, then realizes we don't even have a place setting and she was the one who sat us there. Anyways, we wait for a good 8-10 minutes without any contact from our waiter, only an apology from the hostess. Finally waiter shows up, doesn't seem that interested  and just asks for our order. As a former waiter I was mildly annoyed by this since its usually best to greet the customer, ask if they any questions and make good suggestions. My girlfriend goes with cinnamon rolls\/bacon and I end up with the B&G Steak and Eggs with a Bloody Mary and coffee. We wait, we wait some more. OUR FOOD ARRIVES BEFORE OUR DRINKS? Then our waiter finally delivers drinks and makes blunder after blunder after blunder. I seriously don't know what this guy's deal was.\n\nThe food: Mine was excellent. Steak was perfect (asked for rare, got rare) and the cornmeal pancakes were an amazing addition. Blood Mary almost tasted sweet? Wasn't a fan. My girlfriend's sweet roll was tasty and gourmet tasting but DRY, DRY, DRY. Moral of the story: dropped $60 on non-bottomless brunch for an unusually poor dining experience. I think that was the first time in my life I tipped 12%. Won't be back.","10737":"I went to Physicians Physical Therapy (Avondale) for my tennis elbow I have had for months, I also had pain coming from my neck which caused me horrible headaches, most likely from a pinched nerve.  Before I started PT, I couldn't do simple things, like putting something in the microwave, take out the trash, brush my hair or vacuum.  These guys are so wonderful at what they do and really do care, not to mention make you feel like family.  I feel great and am able to resume my normal activities without any issues.  Thank you guys.  Your the best!!!\n  \nDonna Snyder\nAvondale, AZ","10738":"It was okay... super hyped for no reason. \n\nCame here on a Tuesday afternoon around 2PM. My friend says there are usually line ups for this place, so to my surprise, there were at least 6 empty tables at this time - so we didn't have to wait (and I only had an hour for lunch anyways). We were greeted and seated immediately and handed the one page menu. Very brief and simple, not many choices. \n\nMy friend and I both got a small noodle bowl. The size was decent, and the noodles were made fresh (very uneven though, some thicker and wider than others, and clumped up in bunches). The soup however... maybe it was my taste buds being altered by being sick, but boy, the soup was super salty, and tasted like boiled tap water... I did not have the stomach to finish the rest of my bowl as I hated the taste tap water.. let alone hot tap water!\n\nAlthough this was a neat place to try out... it's more like a once in a life time sorta deal. :P","10739":"Check order if you do takeout.  Missing some of our food and didn't want to drive all the way back to get it.","10740":"Could ya have any less sense of quick service. I could have flown out of D55 to Guatemala to get my own beans, flown back and made my drink quicker. Geez.","10741":"Excellent food and service, pizza outstanding, meatball to die for, good selection of beer and wine, highly recommended!","10742":"Carnivori was delicious! Great dough and tasty toppings. 25-30 minute pick up. Cool venue with a rustic atmosphere.","10743":"So curl my toes with another one of your cr\u00c3\u00aapes as The Cr\u00c3\u00aape Club is quaint, friendly & delicious (my sister's new fave place).  A cr\u00c3\u00aape: type of very thin pancake (French origin, deriving from the Latin crispa, meaning \"curled\"). \n\nMy sister was craving cr\u00c3\u00aapes & asked me to find her a place to go. Of course I checked YELP lol & read their reviews. Some of the reviews on this place are from their temporary other location but still within the Biltmore Fashion Park with their now newer location is next to Williams & Sonoma and is quite charming & adorable. \n\nShe went on a date there since I had to go to work for a couple of hours & loved it so much that she had to share with me & her daughter. She ended up going twice in one day haha. \n\nShe really enjoyed the Caprese (mozzarella, basil pesto tomatoes) & Strawberry 'ShortCrepe' (fresh strawberries, Biscoff crumbles, whipped cream).  Also, got a coconut cupcake & macarons. \n\nWe tried S'Mores Nutella (Nutella, marshmallows, Biscoff crumbles) & Strawberry 'ShortCrepe' with 'cold brew' coffee later.  Everything was deliciously sweet & decadent with very nice staff & owner. \n\nThey have Savory & Sweet Cr\u00c3\u00aapes (w\/additional add-ons if you wish), quiches, Acai bowl, baked goods, French toast, paninis, sandwiches, salads, pressed juices, shakes & other drinks avail.","10744":"Out of all the agents I have referred to Liz Miller has been the one that stands out the most. Having peace at mind knowing Liz will take care of them 100% of the way is priceless! She goes in to negotiate the best deal she can for buyers and seems to always yield the best price for the sellers. Its truly amazing! Thank you for all that you have done for me and my clients Liz. 5 stars all the way!","10745":"This was my go-to breakfast \/ bagel place in Charlotte. The first time one of my friends brought me here, I was pretty skeptical based on the exterior, but once I tried the Grubby Bubby I was hooked. I almost always got the Grubby Bubby with veggie cream cheese and it always hit the spot. I had never had a bagel steamed before Owen's and now I wish I could steam every bagel I eat. Lunch sandwiches are also good here; I always tried to pick a random one from the string of construction-paper sandwiches hung above the counter.","10746":"I had lunch for the first time at this location.  It was located in the New York New York Hotel Casino in Las Vegas.  I've never had an authentic NY deli sandwich, so I have nothing to compare it to.\n\nI ordered at the counter, slid my tray down, picked up the sandwich, ordered drinks, picked up condiments, and paid at the cash register.  They do not offer complimentary tap water.  I wasn't about to pay $2-3 for a bottle of water.\n\nI shared a Sam & Emma sandwich.  I ordered it on sour dough bread and they made it on white.  The sandwich had a stack of turkey, corned beef and pastrami with thousand island dressing served with a pickle for almost $10.  A bag of chips was extra.\n\nI don't know if I would be back.","10747":"Looking for a place to take my teen daughter before her match and found Guy Fieri's in the Linq Hotel.\n\nThere was a wait for outside dining at 11:30am but we got a nice seat inside where she could look out at the strip and I could watch sports on TV.\n\nA big fan of TV cooking she told me I had to get the Motley Que pulled pork sandwich.  Please remember when looking at the menu that they call chips the British way (they really are fries) which confused me at first since he lives in Northern California.  Not wanting to load up too much, had a Greek Salad and water.  The drinks looked amazing, but being the responsible parent I drank an Arnold Palmer.\n\nOur server, Nichole, was very attentive and got our order right away and refilled my drink 3 times before we left. Sounds trivial, but many times I've had Arnold Palmer refills be just iced tea or lemonade.\n\nThe sandwich was amazing and I have to say we were quite surprised at the generous and tasty Greek Salad.  The pulled pork was both crispy and tender and the donkey sauce was nice and sweet.\n\nPrices were quite reasonable.  We also caught a glimpse of the Trash Can Nachos.  They were huge!  That is definitely an appetizer for 5-6 people.  The two people who ordered it barely ate a third and encouraged others to eat it!","10748":"Do not stay at this hotel. Management is stealing money. Mexican manager Juan inflates prices per week. The staff is incompetent. You can never get a straight answer regarding billing. I questioned why weekly payment did not go down once all \"fees\" and \"deposits\" were paid. Mexican manager Juan told me to pack my things and leave. I was fully prepared to pay fee that was quoted to me by staff member Brenda. Mexican manager Juan informed me she did not quote me the correct amount. He stated she failed to add in a pet fee and charge from previous week. When Mexican manager Juan gave me a total it was the total I paid the week before. When I pointed this out to him he became angry and enrage and yelled that he would not do business with me. They owe me a deposit. This company will say you will get a refund on your $100 deposit but you have to stay 30 days or more. I was due my refund this week. I tried to call corporate but only get a voicemail when I call the number. Person on message sounds just like Mexican manager Juan. I contacted the Better Business Bureau since I cannot get a return call from Siegal Suites Corporate office. I have kept all documents regarding my stay at this hell hole. Please beware of this facility. There are roaches, open drug trades, prostitution and children unattended running everywhere. Complained about the marijuana smells coming thru apartment and was laughed at by Brenda. I only gave this review a one star b\/c you have to give a star in order to leave a review. This establishment needs to be shut down. All criminal activity needs to be investigated. This establishment preys on the desperate. Thank GOD I have other means.","10749":"Surprised and pleased to find these folks.  The creative food and the quality beer really hit the spot.  The decor was all wrong, but we were so happy with everything else that we didn't mind.  Will definitely be coming back!","10750":"The Root Cafe is more than a coffee shop. Their food is top notch, focusing on organic, locally sourced (when possible) ingredients, made fresh. The gent behind the counter was extremely helpful when I asked about the menu. He was more than willing to give the chef any special instructions, offering to change the dish any way I wanted. It turned out he didn't need to do that, but it made me feel very welcomed. \n\nThe interior is inspired, and inspiring. Whenever I think of the Root Cafe, the word \"rainforest\" pops into my head. Situated on the corner of a busy Lakewood intersection, the large picture windows overlook both a sidewalk, and a leafy church lawn. Some ivy even creeps up the side of the window. wrought iron is used throughout the space to create leafy, organic functioning structures, like branches that are actually stools. The Root Cafe serves Phoenix coffee and has live music often. They also serve beer! \n\nFree wifi","10751":"Have been my family's go to place for replacement of watch batteries.  We come here all the way from West Summerlin. Great friendly service.  And one thing for sure, they know watches. Unlike the Fast and Fix place in Downtown Summerlin, the woman that works there doesn't even know my watch, and asked me how much its worth and told me that it would be $125.00 to change battery on my watch and to take out some links on a new watch would be $25.00.  We brought our business here at M & I, it cost only $25.00 for the battery and $10.00 to remove links on the new watch.\nThank you M and I !!!","10752":"Probably the best happy hour for Mexican cuisine! You can get a loaded steak quesadilla and a beer (or two ) for under $20! Of course the flaming fajitas are great, but how would they not be! It's in the name!","10753":"Food was excellent. Had the Brussels, Shrimp and Grits, and a piece of the fried chicken. Everything was tasty.","10754":"Awesome customer service with awesome company! Always a great place to hungry friends from Hawaii.","10755":"Very hearty breakfast portions, so much so that I could take half of it home and eat it the next day. Created my own omelet (bacon, red peppers, goat cheese) and it was tasty. Hash browns were also good. Definitely large enough to split and save money.","10756":"Unfortunately, I recently had to return a purchase that I made at Brilliance New York in Vegas. My husband found out how much I spent and needless to say he was not pleased. \n\nThe products literally worked like magic!  I saw instant results with the pore treatment as well as the eye serum. \n\nThe customer service was excellent. Anabel at corporate was delightful to work with. Even thought they state that they all sales are final, she was able to issue a refund for me in a few days. \n\nThe products are amazing and so is the customer service! I can't wait to place a new order once I have a bit more money saved up :)","10757":"Really tasty, fresh Italian food. This is probably one of the only Italian restaurants in Scarborough, so I go here all the time with my grandfather who lives nearby. The service is really good - and the food comes out very fast. I always get the penne arrabiata or tortellini - both are delicious. Tomato sauce isn't too spicy. The soups are also always tasty if you're getting an appetizer - I recommend the minestrone. Most of my family members always get the veal with a side of spaghetti. I'm a vegetarian so it's not my style, but it's very popular. - it's also massive.","10758":"Oh My Sweetness! I stopped by the Sugar Factory a lot during my visit to Las Vegas. The Sugar Factory is conveniently located on the LV strip. I instantly became a fan of the dessert selection at Sugar Factory. I was overwhelmed by the choices. I treated myself to gelato every time I visited the Sugar Factory. The gelato was the perfect cooling off treat for the Vegas heat. The staff lets you sample different gelatos. I mixed different gelato flavors, very tasty. I purchased two candy apples to take back to Virginia with me. The candy apples were delicious. I like how the candy apple did not lack toppings. I will try the full menu(food) at Sugar Factory on my next visit to Las Vegas. Sugar Factory is a great choice to fulfill your sweet tooth needs on the Las Vegas strip.","10759":"Lets just say its an experience!  ;-)\nThe food was very good, and they have huge portions here.  The colors\/theme and atmosphere is a must see, we will be going back!","10760":"No stars would be a more accurate rating. My feet feel like sand paper after a pedicure. Their recommendation: go home and put some vaseline. More nail polish on my toes than on my nails. Never going back.","10761":"Had to get my wing fix, I like dry rubs on wings they had 3 different types couldn't choose between 6 pepper, smoked and cajun style so I just got all three. \nAll were great but if I needed to choose I would go with the 6 pepper, along with incredible craft beer offered makes this place a great stopping place while passing threw !","10762":"Their fatty brisket is my new warm happy place.  \n\nToday is my 11th wedding anniversary, and my amazing wife suggested we try LMB for our anniversary celebration.  Am I the luckiest guy in the world or what?\n\nOk, the line sucks.  The parking sucks.  Doesn't matter.  One taste of the food and all that stuff melts away like the glistening hunks of delicious brisket melts in your mouth.\n\nWe tried the fatty brisket, pulled pork, sausage, pork ribs, and the daily special beef short ribs on the bone.  For sides, we got the beans, grits (amazing), and potato salad.  \n\nAll of the meats are wonderful, perfectly smoked with a peppery bark.  The beef rib was remarkably unctuous and flavorful.  The fatty brisket though.  Damn.  It's succulent, incredible, simply the best piece of BBQ I've ever experienced.  I literally am starting to drool as I write this review and am reminiscing on the brisket.\n\nOh...and here is a good tip...get the pickles.  They are fantastic and and provide a perfect sharp crispy cold counterpoint to the glorious meat candy.\n\nThe price is not cheap.  Doesn't matter.  They are using only prime meat and you can instantly tell the difference.  Their product is worth the premium.\n\nAlso, I can't forget about the good folks who run this joint.  Everyone we encountered was so nice and wore their passion for the BBQ proudly on their sleeves.  Special kudos to the older gentleman who was expertly orchestrating the parking lot & told us all about what to try and some of the history while we were in line, and also the guy working the smokers.  He invited my wife back to show her the process he uses with the brisket, what an awesome treat!\n\nOk, I've gone on long enough.  A gold star for you if you're still actually reading this far down in the review.  Why are you still reading this?  Get in your car & head downtown to LMB.  The line is already forming, hurry!","10763":"The restaurant was fairly quiet for a weekend with a hockey game. The staff were fairly quick to get us seated as we were part of a group of 13. Our server was friendly but very slow to get us our drinks. My wife asked for a baileys and coffee and the server said they had to brew a pot yet the coffee came back lukewarm. I joked that maybe they added extra baileys and it cooled down, no such luck. Our meals were terribly slow to come and they were incorrect on 4 of the 13 meals. Refills and other drinks were very slow to come and incorrect at times. The manager hovered around the front desk from time to time but never once walked around to see how any tables were doing including ours which was surprising considering our size and we were purchasing drinks with our meals. This is only the second time I have been there even though I live less than 5 minutes away and I will not be back.","10764":"La comida del buffet fue realmente sabrosa, hab\u00c3\u00ada variedad en cuanto a desayunos y cena. Los precios un poco caros pero vale la pena. Bebidas casi de todo tipo. Definitivamente volver\u00c3\u00a9 cuando visite vegas otra vez!","10765":"We stayed there this weekend and upgraded to a suite that costed over $2000.00 for the stay. There were bugs in the room, it took 3 calls for in room dining to clean up. We had an issue with management Shari and Manuel the front desk managers. Very RUDE!! We will never stay there again. By far the Bellagio and Caesars are 100% better than this Venetian.","10766":"AWWWWESOOOOMMMEEEE!!!!!! Hot waitresses, great atmosphere, great decor, food ROCKS! So glad we found out about this place. Ate here after a long night at EDC. Boom!","10767":"Saw good reviews on Yelp for Waldo's and decided to give them a try. Ordering was a very easy process. The gentlemen that takes the order repeats the order back and hands the ticket to the cooks right away so they can start on your order while he finishes cashing out. Quick team, tacos were done within 10 minutes. 13 tacos totaled $24 rounded up. \n\n- Camarones\/shrimp tacos: 3\/5, shrimp has a batter that was already soft and soaked in oil. Avocados were old and mushy. \n\n- Tripas taco: 2\/5: Not as good as other places that I've had tripas from. The tripas came out crispy but it was burnt and fatty. \n\n- Asada tacos: 3\/5: the meat had very little flavor and tasted bland. Relied on limes and hot sauces to help it out. \n\n- Pastor tacos: 4\/5: the best out of the four. Very flavorful, seasoned well.","10768":"They need more employees on shift because this place gets slammed and they only ever have 2 people working. \n\nDecent pitaya and acai bowls! It's hard for me to find good acai bowls because nothing compares to the deliciousness of Pressed for Juice acai bowl. \n\nBuuuut I come here because they offer pitaya and most places don't have that option. My favorite is the peanut butter pitaya bowl. It's so goooood. Their regular size is a lot, I don't think I've ever finished one completely.","10769":"Unfortunately, the house we purchased and fell in love with has carpet. I say \"unfortunate\" because we are dog lovers. We own two French Bulldogs that we are obsessed with. The only problem is... Dogs + Carpet =  Gross. Period. They shed. They track in dirt. They slobber. They snort. They wiggle. They're basically two little piggy-poos that live with us. Oink. Oink.\n\nWhat's a girl to do? Oh yeah... Call Nobel Cleaners. They're the best. \n\nThere's a reason they have a gazillion five star reviews. It's because they're incredible. We've used their services twice and both times they were extremely thorough, prompt, professional, friendly, and provided a quote and stuck to it. In fact, they over quoted us and upon completion of their work charged us less. Yeah, they're top-notch carpet superheroes. \n\nIf your carpets are looking less than dapper and are needing some TLC... give these carpet superheroes a call. They will come to your rescue and have your carpets looking brand new in no time! They're piggy-poo approved.","10770":"I was surprised by the high rating of this restaurant and my experience as it certainly was not the same. As a vegan I am always on the lookout for a wonderful vegan experience and this was unfortunately it. Let me break it down for you. \n\nUnlike a true upscale restaurant you order as you come in the door. The menu is written on table paper and pinned to the wall. After you order you have to walk around and find an available table. We were fortunate that we found one fairly quickly. \n\nMeals: bland. Because I am unfamiliar with the type of food Apteka serves I  ordered the 2nd dish on the large plates and had my partner order the peorogies. I was surprised that my meal was actually a salad. Why would I go to a vegan restaurant to order a salad when I can get that anywhere...this is what my friends said when my order came. The salad was good but not great.  My partner shared his meal with me but the sauce tasted sour so I didn't like it. \n\nCons: I don't like ordering my dinner at a counter, grabbing my silverware and finding my own table in this type of restaurant. While the servers, or food runners, were pleasant they did not come back to check on you. \n\nPositives: the service and atmosphere. The food came quickly and the atmosphere was great although a little too dark for my liking. \n\nI am truly upset that I cannot support my community of vegans but this is not an establishment that I nor my friends would visit again. For a true pleasant vegan experience I'll go back to the Doublewide Grill.","10771":"My son and I went to \"The Meg\" at the Red Stone Cinemas and felt like we pretty much wasted our money. We saw the PDX version (Premium Digital Experience) which, according to what they told us at the ticket counter, was better sound and 3D effects. The only thing that was intense (in a good way) about it was the sound was better, but the picture part of it was not worth the $38 that we paid for.  $38 for one adult and two kids....totally not worth it. Plus, the price for food at theaters now is absolutely ridiculous!!!  For the three of us, including the cost of the tickets was over $65. It pretty much costs as much as dinner would cost at a 5-Star restaurant. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about the movie. The movie was great, very suspenseful. The amount that it cost, however, was totally not worth it!!  We feel like we definitely got ripped off at this theatre!!","10772":"When I found out Muji was opening up in Toronto I was super ecstatic! \n\nThe first time I went the ever so popular store known for their stationary, the majority of it was gone and the touch screen gloves were sold out, something which I was hoping to buy. \n\nThe second time I ended up buying erasers as I lost my erasers. I know it may sound silly to write a review on erasers but I was pretty upset when I lost mine and they work well compared to other erasers I've used. I ended up buying a few of them for fear I may lose them again and it's very common for erasers to go missing. \n\nHowever, something I was disappointed about was the fact they did not have the touch screen gloves again. They told me they were sold out before Christmas break which to me was a while ago. It's February now. It could be the shipping and handling but if something was sold out that fast, you would think they'd restock again soon.\n\nThe coolest part about the store in my opinion was the stamping station where you get to design the simplicity of the notebooks. Although the stamps were limited, designing the notebooks was just a fun activity to do, especially for visitors who were visiting the store for the first time.","10773":"Very juicy patties. Had the double primeburger with poutine. Fries are good as well. I liked the way the burgers are wrapped, which made it less messy. The price was also reasonable given the quality of the burgers.","10774":"If you are thinking about bringing your compound pharmacy needs here - DON'T! Twice now they have had issues filling my prescription in a timely manner causing me to be days without my medication. THEY TAKE 5 -10 BUSINESS DAYS to fill a prescription...when things go right. This month I called in my refill 8 days prior to needing it. I prepaid for the medication and, because this location was closed from water damage, they offered one time free delivery. They said it would be delivered on the 22nd (a week away). There was no delivery on the 22nd so I called on the 23rd. They told me they had made a clerical error and my prescription had never been filled. So I'm thinking they are going to put someone right on it and get it done - NOPE. The earliest they could get it done was in 7 days. I told them I would run out of medication in 2 days - still the earliest they could do was 7 days. I told them this was the second month in a row they haven't been able to fill in a timely manner. They said again, 7 days. If I needed it sooner, I would have to call around to find a compound pharmacy that could get it done sooner. Both times, they did nothing to help me and even when it was their mistake- it was my problem. Horrible customer service.","10775":"Super delish bagels and the best thing to eat after a sad Bowl lost. Long lines are always good. Endless options for all and I ended up with the Gwacka Flacka Flame! They are steamed bagels it had turkey, lettuce, tomato, guacamole, and Siracha. I definitely recommend this place as it looked like both locals and visitors alike love it. Staff was awesome! They have ice coffee on tap.  I wish there was a shop in Nashville because I would be there.","10776":"The fact that the toy store is closing is less depressing when there is a spirits store that has everything.  It's just about that same giddy feeling of what can I find? \n\nAnd samples.  Did I mention samples? Not sure which one of the thousands of choices of wine to choose? Head over to the tasting station and find out if you like it first.\n\nIs wine not really your thing?  That's fine.  They carry pretty much every brand of beer, brandy, whiskey, vodka or whatever your choice of spirits are here.  At very competitive prices.  \n\nWhile every aisle is labeled nicely if you are lost in the sheer volume of selections there are plenty of associates that are friendly and helpful.  \n\nThey card anyone that looks less than 30.  Personally I don't have issues with that.  It's the law.  And if someone tells me I look younger than 30 I smile and thank them for looking past my wrinkles and decade old baby weight and hand them my ID.","10777":"I wrote a review a couple of weeks ago about Dr. Auto.  Since then John the owner has reached out to me to try and make things right.  My car cannot be made right again, but I appreciate the effort and the stand-up gesture he made.  \nAs I said in my original review, I don't think any of the mistakes were intentional - it just happened.  \nThe three stars are for doing the right thing.  Thank you.","10778":"It's a Starbucks, what more can you expect? The location is decent, inside the Westin hotel and it only gets crowded in the morning hours. There is comfy seating, you can also take your drink over to the bar area on the first floor or sit at one of the slot machines.","10779":"I spent about three and a half hours reading customer reviews on a number of area AC repair services. I settled on AZ Dukes of Air because of the great reviews I read. I have to say that I am so happy that this is the company I selected. I called shortly after 7:00 am,  was given a time window of 10-12, and Robert arrived at 1035. He was done in just over an hour. He was efficient, courteous, and very much able to put things into terms that I could understand. I feel that the amount I was charged was fair for the work that he did. I will definitely call them again when I need AC service. Thank you Tonya, for getting me a same-day appointment. Thank you, Robert, for being the wonderful technician that you are!","10780":"Walked in, walked out. $7 bologna sandwich with no sides is their advertised $6 lunch. (All others $8+ and No one else was in there for lunch at 12- all I need to know. )","10781":"Everything was great but how does a brand new place run out of food when it just recently opened and it is trying to get loyal customers. Half of the things they promote is their food and for them to not be serving it, and without any sign of notice until I got to the register is extremely disappointing. \n\nThe staff seemed extremely all over the place and the person yelling out order numbers was being overly aggressive when calling them out.","10782":"I honestly thought that all Winchells had closed down years ago, but found this location on Yelp.  I was told by the owner that this specific store is independently owned while the others in Vegas are part of the Winchells chain.  When I was a kid, my dad used to frequent another Winchells and when I was in junior high, there was a Winchells by the local movie theater and that's where my friends and I would stop for our doughnut fix.  Because my parents were regulars, they always brought back twists, apple fritters, and maple bars - so guess what I bought during this trip?\n\nAlthough, these weren't fresh from the oven (we showed up around 4pm), the donuts were still soft and super tasty.  They weren't overly sweet and perfect with a cup of coffee.  I left myself half of the apple fritter for breakfast the next morning and it was still soft and delicious.  There's something about their dough that I find perfect for my taste buds and the texture is always soft and slightly chewy.  I will always love Winchells and if I ever have kids, best believe that they'll be Winchells lovers too!","10783":"Driving thru Boulder City on our way to Phoenix and we were looking for a place that could let us stretch our legs and wasn't fast food. WE HIT A HOMERUN! For the three of us, we ordered a western bacon cheeseburger, regular cheeseburger, fries, fried zucchini and the mac n cheese bites. All of the food was hot, fresh and cooked exactly the way we ordered. Service was a bright spot too! Wish it was closer to my home in Sparks, NV. This will be a 'must have' anytime we're in town. Thanks!","10784":"Great food but service was a bit slow 2nd time we went. (And it wasn't busy.) Decor was African bush themed, upscale & interesting. Unfortunately the BBQ pulled pork sandwich was taken off the menu... During my first visit in ordered this with house coleslaw (which was the BEST I've ever had anywhere) & wanted it again. Wish chef would have made it upon request, but he didn't. This visit I ordered the chicken breast sandwich with Fry's & their amazing coleslaw; which was tasty. My mom ordered a cheeseburger that she enjoyed. Was nothing special about it but tasty nonetheless. I'd definitely come back for the slaw if nothing else. It's worth a look see & enjoy! Bon Apatite'.","10785":"No stars for this business..Dropped off a dress for alteration on a Saturday with a promise to complete on Thursday. Showed up to pick up dress on Friday morning and not done. No apology and not even an excuse. If I didn't have a party in Friday I would have taken unaltered dress and left. Done last minute with a lot of stress. Will not return to this business. Not reliable.","10786":"I don't shop here often but it's cool to know that when you see something in a magazine or online and it's only available at Neiman Marcus that we have one and you can stop in and check it out in person.\n\nGreat selection of top-end designer brands that you can't find anywhere else. I recently stopped to check out some Tom Ford stuff and was suitably impressed. \n\nOh, and don't be intimidated by the sales staff. They live and work here just like the rest of us.","10787":"I came to Steiner's last week becasue I wanted a Reuben and I saw theirs was recommended.  Little did I know that I was coming on the same night as the NBA finals last game.  I don't follow hoops.  So I was kind of frustrated when they switched the channels from a baseball game and a hockey game I was watching in favor of the NBA finals.  How dare they!  But nobody else seemed to mind so oviously I was in the minority.  Regardless, I was here for a sandwich.  Not sports.  And a sandwich I got.  It was not the kind of Reuben I was craving.  The sliced thin and stacked tall beef with cheese, sauerkraut and dressing like at Jason's Deli.  It was thicker sliced beef and not stacked as high as I wanted.  Still, this was a good sandwich.  Great flavor. Plenty filling.  Dry rye bread with just the right amount of dressing to help it down the gullet.  Actually more cheesey than what I had wanted.  And that is not a bad thing.  Cheese is good friend of mine.  Although this was not what I had pictured in my mind,  I did not leave disappointed.  And that is a win in my book.  Also, the coleslaw on the side was respectable.  Not the best slaw I've had but nothing to scoff at.  Service was also commendable. I was seen by at least four people.  One who took my drink order.  One who took my food order.  One who brought my food to the table.  And one who removed my empty plate.  They were mostly quick to my table.  And friendly.  This surprised me given how busy the place was on this final night of the NBA season.  Kudos to Steiner's for a job well done from a belly well fed.","10788":"My husband and I frequent this place; we go once or twice a month on the average.  Gaetano's is great Italian food with an excellent wine list.  Best of all, Gaetano's is in our neighborhood!  The food has great flavor. Meats are always served to our desired doneness. Seafood and poultry items on the menu are juicy and tender. Pasta is cooked al dente while the sauces always make me want to lick my plate clean!  I love listening to their specials although you can't go wrong ordering from the menu. I recommend the burrata, the baked artichoke stuffed with Parmesan (an occasional special), the mushroom soup (also a special) and caprese for starters, the Mezzelune di Vitello con Porcini for pasta, and the Ossobuco alla Milanese for your entree, the tiramisu for dessert paired with THE cappuccino (not the regular one but the owner's own recipe).  Then again, like I said, you can't go wrong with any item from the menu.\n\nI most especially like the feeling that the restaurant exudes.  You can certainly feel the welcome from the family that runs the place. The service is very personal. Nick who is often our server, treats us very well.  I also enjoy small talks with his father who is usually the host for the evening when he comes around to the tables. The floor plan and lighting make you feel cozy. It is not too small as to constrict you nor is it too big that it loses the intimacy.  I can come in shorts and flip-flops or in a little black satin dress and I'd be fine.  They send you a gift certificate for a free dinner to celebrate your birthday which is redeemable within your birth month. They often email you discount coupons too.  Occasionally, the restaurant will have set dinner menu pairing events hosted by wineries which are well worth the price because they are often generous with their pours and with pour refills.\n\nFrom appetizers to desserts, Gaetano's is a hearty meal for its value. You pay not only for the quality and the decent sized portion of food, but also for the service, and the ambiance.","10789":"The best thing about this place is the building and neighborhood in which it sits.\n\nThe doctors are limited in time and knowledge. They always have seemed as they were guessing on a diagnosis or just perscribing a useless test to protect themselves. Not to mention an average office visit is $175. The staff often seemed clueless and rude. Not sure how or if there is any regulatory organization monitoring this tragedy.\n\nIt is shocking how this company gets away with such a poor service in this neighborhood.","10790":"Miller's handled the work needed for our insurance claim very efficiently and professionally.  We had very significant water damage on a manufactured house.  They communicated promptly both with me and with the insurance company, and with subcontractors.  The subcontractors they referred me to were also very good communicators, and efficient about their work.  All very nice people.  Everyone on their team was available and forthcoming with answers to all my questions.  I would recommend them and I would solicit their services again!","10791":"I'm giving 5 stars for the young officer that came out that had the the tact to deal with a person like me. Before this. I live in Ahwatukee for some reason the officers here are too salty for their own good. I was on vacation in Las Vegas and saw on the news some kid got shot at Andy's with an air soft gun. Walking distance from me. My neighbors across the way had shot me with an air soft gun a month prior and the police did nothing. I'm a mentally unstable veteran and I drink. I get that. But when these two idiots came I was treated very inappropriate. Both the rookie and the \"veteran\" were rude the second they knocked on my door. I guess it's my fault for being stern back to them. Even my dog didn't like these dicks and all she does is sleep.","10792":"Great service and fair price. We received several quotes for our tree, some almost double  what Aron charged. He recommended we take down the tree since it was a hazard and from start to clean up they took down a 20 ft tree in 40 min.","10793":"You will see pieces here that you may never have a chance to see again. It is connected to the Museum of Natural History (recommended). However, this is not a hands on playground for young children. If your kids are wanting to run, climb, touch, them maybe bypass this. But if they are old enough to show respect & restraint then def give this a try.","10794":"Company brought there food truck to work to treat us and I was a bit skeptical but that Beef brisket . Very good and their garlic potatoes were amazing.","10795":"We were looking to get something to eat and we decided on Asian food, and we went here. The service is very slow, food was ok but it is way over priced. The ambience was nice.","10796":"Always packed on the weekend, but usually worth the wait.  Great pancakes for those like me who aren't egg fanatics.  The Construction Pancake comes with great bacon, bland sausage and really good sliced potatoes.  Servers are usually frazzled, but good.","10797":"i was very disappointed with there dim sun. it tasted like it was frozen not fresh & left over from the day before. in other words terrible.","10798":"I loved this show so much I wanted to watch it again right after it finished. It's not the typical Cirque show, but a perfect tribute to the Beatles...Cirque does the fab four proud! If your looking for the typical Cirque show I would not recommend this one (try O), but I love the Beatles so maybe I'm biased. I did not love the giftshop and their $40 t-shirts tho...","10799":"Carefully prepared Asian fusion cuisine made with high quality ingredients. Service was attentive without being annoying. Interesting cocktail selections with premium spirits and fresh squeezed juices and house made syrups. I loved the seasonal sangria.","10800":"The ice cream is good, but the service is poor. The guy at counter not only took his time greeting us when we walked in,  but also took his time getting our order, and making it. The co-worker that was there with him went to hide in the backroom while he struggled to get the first cup of ice cream made. Finally she came out of hiding and helped him. Still slow, but no longer at a snails pace. Gave the 1 star rating bcuz of the service and lack of cleanliness.  The tables look like they haven't been touched with hot water in days.","10801":"Stopped by here late night to get take out. I was starving but wanted to get straight to bed. Ordered the burger medium and it was fantastic. Thick patty, garlic aioli, and melted cheese (not sure what kind). And, the fries were perfect. Once the staff realized we had just gotten married (hence the wedding dress) they tossed in free dessert. The oatmeal cookies were some of the best I've ever had. Not a cheap late night eat, but well worth it!","10802":"Valet parking review only- OMG YES!\n\nWhen you pull up and you are trying to decide if you should pay the extra to valet? Yes! Do it! \n\n1- If you don't you will find yourself parking lightyears away in a garage that requires maps to get you back to your family!\n\n2- And most importantly these guys are hustling like I have never seen before! They are amazing!!! So kind, courteous and professional. \n\nTip- take a pic of your ticket and text them when you need your car, they will then have it ready for you right away when you come downstairs, air on and ready to go. \n\nThey are amazing- well done Kimpton! ROCKSTARS- all of them!","10803":"What impressed me the most was the fast service with having so many customers. Great customer service!! Food was very tasty, of good quality, great presentation and reasonably priced. Definitely coming back!","10804":"Gluten free fried chicken. Yes, you read that right. It exists and it's here and it is so glorious I cannot even. Just can't even. Crunchy, greasy, salty perfection with juicy meat. Add a side of grits and all is well with the world. It was so good I was thisclose to tears. It had been many years since my fried chicken palate was satisfied, and once I took that first bite of that beautiful dish I asked the server if she was sure she put the right order in..this can't be gluten free. Heaven help us, it's 12 hours later and I'm not sick. Please note that they do fry it in a separate oil and away from any cross contamination so it will take a little longer to come out. We ordered it as soon as we sat down. Worth the wait. \n\nTry the Southern Peach for a sweet cocktail. It pairs well with the decadence of the chicken. Oh, the deviled eggs are creamy and savory and not your mom's stuff she served at the holidays. \n\nService was excellent; the entire staff was happy to talk with us, even the manager came out and asked about my gluten free experience. I cannot wait to come back and inhale an entire order on my own - hubby and I shared it with the grits and eggs and left full and happy.","10805":"Noodle soup was horrible. Generic noodles and either a lack of flavor or too much msg in the other. The boba tea was also sitting around for a while so I had to return it.\n\nBelagio's Noodle House is still the place for asian food on the strip.","10806":"This place is pretty good for a food court shop. I especially am a fan of their grilled chicken fresh rolls, they are just fantastic and are served with a peanut dipping sauce. I often grab them to take home for dinner. Their other dishes are good too, it's fairly good thai food to be honest, which is why they have big line ups at lunch. \n\nTheir food is fresh, and not overcooked nor does it sit in the hot table all day either. good service, friendly counter staff and good quality food keeps me coming back. :)","10807":"Who knew you could actually have a pleasant experience involving your broken iPhone? These guys were amazing, fast, friendly and helpful. They fixed my screen in less than 20 minutes for a fair price. I feel like I have a new phone again. Hopefully I don't need a repair again but if I do I will definitely go back to them.","10808":"For all those negative comments, I'd just like to say something positive on here. I think one of the greatest strengths of NYS is Melanie. For those who can't seem to actually be adults and face things like an adult, I just want people to know that she is a great coordinator. We have returned every year just for soccer and understand that other people may feel different but I see firsthand that many people may disagree. But you should you give it a shot and see for yourself .","10809":"I liked it! The bar is beautiful and in such a great spot, I loved the big open ceiling and huge windows and plants everywhere. I loved the quote on the way up the stairs that got the Leonard Cohen song Suzanne in my head on my way in. All of the staff were kind and helpful and present, and I loved the vegan Whisky Sour and the glass of sparkling wine I had. \n\nThe food, I gotta by real, was only ok. We started with oysters which were fresh, and not outrageously priced which I appreciate, but they weren't cut out of their shells which made them pretty hard to eat. We got six with a regular mignonette, and 6 with a house special with a kind of watermelon foam that for me just didn't work. Too sweet, just weird with oysters. We also ordered some dumplings, I had the one veggie option on the menu, basically pureed eggplant which I loved the taste of but the dumpling skins were too thick and heavy. \n\nI will definitely go back because I really liked the vibe. There's other little bites on the menu I'd try but mostly I'd go for drinks with friends.","10810":"After everything that has happened for the last few days, this was one of the first places my coworker wanted to visit after we got our rental car.\n\nThis was a nice place to unwind after the hustle and bustle of being on the strip for most of the week during my time at a conference. Bagels are absolutely delicious and quite cheap. The different spreads (known as schmears) they have for their bagels are also very varied, and delicious.\n\nUnfortunately, for most of the conference I was very sick and was constantly hacking a lung. So I reached for a strawberry lemonade to help wake me up and soothe my throat, not knowing how much it was, and expecting to pay quite a bit. But nope! About $2, which is even cheaper than back home.\n\nAlso customer service was very friendly, even though there was a bit of a misunderstanding.\n\nNice and quiet (with the exception of me coughing. Sorry, everyone.) and perfect for a quick sit down snack or light meal.","10811":"Good enough -- though it wasn't great.\nWith a place like BP coming into Mississauga, it moves the expectations up. They fell a bit short -- however, if its right in your area -- its great.","10812":"If it is all about the food for you, then this is a great place.  Nice variety of dishes, well seasoned, cooked to perfection.  My top choice in LV for going out with friends without having them blanch at the final bill.   \n\nService is generally good, but not consistent.  Not a fan of the location or the decor, but the great food makes up for these relatively minor negatives.","10813":"Came here for a morning\/lunch buffet and it sucked bad! My friends and I were hungover, not to mention starving, and were too lazy to walk over to Paris for their buffet so we decided to just try it here since we stayed in Bally's anyways.\n\nI didnt enjoy the food one bit. The good thing about this place is that it has quite a lot of seating so there wasn't any waiting when we arrived, but I dont think i'll ever be back.","10814":"This is my favorite place to get tea. I always get the sweetened passion fruit tea, it's amazing. The employees are really nice and fun to talk to. If you don't know what you want just ask them what they like. They always recommend the best drinks.","10815":"When you first walk into this place, it seems like an English afternoon tea cafe.  It's actually a cafe from Taiwan and part of a restaurant chain.\n\nThe food is very very very average, it's like average food dressed up in tuxedo, every drink has been dressed up with flakes of roses, fancy eh?  The chicken spaghetti was ok, although could be better if it was more flavourful.    The lychee strawberry drink that I got was nothing more than lychee juice you could buy from supermarket dressed up fancy with rose flakes.\n\nService was good and prompt, they even cut the toast for you.   The dinning time is 90 minutes maximum so it's not a place to chill for a long time.\n\nThe cafe gives good first impression with its design and feel but it lacks good food to compliment it.","10816":"This place is the worst \"Brazilian\" restaurant in Vegas. Has the feel of a Sizzler and the quality of food is less appealing. Asked for chimichurri and no one working there knew what that was...yeah...real authentic. Save your money even if it's the Groupon deal.","10817":"Highly recommend this company. One of our A\/C units stopped working and the warranty company sent 2 different service companies that could not solve the problem. The owner came out in a timely manner, diagnosed the problem, handled the warranty company claim and the ultimately finished the job ahead of schedule.","10818":"Got take out. Very generous portions. I probably shouldn't have gotten the spicy white beans though, a little too spicy for me haha. Overall great food though! My 3 year old approves which is saying a lot.","10819":"We arrived at the time right before dinner was being served. Well, first of all the bread was terrible, yeah I eat it with almost everything including meat. The crab legs were OK but someone I went with said it really wasn't that great. The sushi was subpar and didn't look all that fresh. Deserts were the only thing I really enjoyed from this establishment. \n\nTo the sum it all up its worth going to but not for over $23. There are BETTER buffets on and off the strip, Good Luck!","10820":"I purchased a living social gift certificate and this was my first visit. I will definitely go back. This is an outstanding service oriented salon. I have short thick hair and Allison gave me one of the best haircuts I have ever received! I have already made my second appointment.","10821":"Fun way to get out of the sun for a few hours.  Great spot to bring the family or hang with friends.  Drinks, food and golf. Lots of TV's.\n\nAll around a fun time!","10822":"Fantastic...a gentlemen greeted me as I walked in and kindly helped me with the menu. Ordered the samosa chaat and chicken biryani. Had no idea what either were but it was all delicious. Beautiful restaurant too. Highly recommended.","10823":"Visiting Montreal for the weekend, this place had a lot of hype.  The service was very nice, but the bagel was a typical bagel to me.  They are cash only!","10824":"This is WAY nicer than the Bloomingdale B&N I usually visit! I will be back! It is so organized, plus they have all the new arrivals and best sellers nicely organized in the front adjacent to the Starbucks inside. I wish that was a Dunkin Donuts for sure though! I will be back!","10825":"This is the spot you hit before you go to Heinz hall for the symphony.  I've only ever eaten one entree here, but that's only because I kept getting it every time I came here.  I forget the name, but it's trout that's stuffed with lump crabmeat on one side, oyster's Rockafeller on the other, and all topped off with a white wine cream sauce.  That plus 2 glasses of wine and you may fall asleep during your Rachmanonov.","10826":"I went here with my mother and father in law. We really didn't know what to expect if it was like a subway or if it was something else. We were greeted warmly and were helped with a selection of sandwich we wanted. Well I wish I could give a honest review of the meal but they so happened to mess up the entire order. I'm not sure how it was done but needless to say it was. So someday I hope to go back and give a more solid review of the food.","10827":"Absolute WORST EXPERIENCE. I do love Hooters Wings, but won't EVERRR GO BACK HERE. Extremely EXHAUSTED I DECIDED TO GO DOWN TO THE HOOTERS RESTAURANT. Unbeknownst to me it takes over 45 mins to get a 10 pc wings to go. So I thought. After waiting over 40 mins while sitting at the bar, I asked the hostess \"does it normally take this long?\". She replied \"what did you have?\" I stated a 10 pc Hot. She turned grab a bag and said \"well we didn't know where you went\"........ ummmmmm at the same bar you brought my water and receipt to. ON THE SAME CHAIR!!!!!! \n\nI asked for the Manager and Mikey comes up and immediately starts to explain how long the wings take.......I'm looking really puzzled now. I'm focused on the customer service aspect of being notified that my order was ready then handed a bag with cold wings. I verrrrrryyyyyyy calmly stated Mikey I'm simply providing feedback on my experience and food takes time to cook I understand that, HOWEVER BETTER POLICIES SHOULD BE IN PLACE IN REGARDS TO YOUR TO-GO CUSTOMERS.","10828":"How could you go wrong with a slice loaded with shawarma for $2.50? It might look a little shady\/ghetto but don't let that fool you! Food is amazing and cheap here. Would 100% recommend!","10829":"I was so looking to playing a round of golf but Mother Nature had other ideas. I might as well get something to eat while waiting for the rain to clear.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to find Bibimbap on the menu so I had to try it. It may not have been as authentic as what I've had at Korean restaurants but it was pretty good. I had requested no cucumbers and they were happy to comply. My playing partners seemed to enjoy their meals also.\n\nThe restaurant was busy with many other golfers waiting out the rain. Unfortunately, it started raining a lot harder while we were eating and then came the hail and wind. We never made it out to the golf course. We would have needed a canoe to get around out there. Darn you, Mother Nature!","10830":"I have been to Guys in NY and now Vegas. The food is great burgers are HUGE, the nachos a must! Great atmosphere and staff!","10831":"This is one of our favorite middle eastern restaurants and it's very close to home. We've dined in and ordered take-out often.  They dont have a full bar, but allowed to bring your own wine and\/or beer with you. The ambiance is very simple, casual and cozy. The owner, Ali, is very friendly as well as his staff.  Our favorite dish is the Fetaita wrap which is a combo of feta cheese, hummus, tabouli and fresh vegetables. I always ask for extra diced cucumbers since It's my fave.  For an appetizer, get the Jajeek, yogurt dip minced w garlic and mint topped w cucumbers and olive oil; comes with pita bread.  Grape leaves and side of rice is always good, too!  \nI dont think you could go wrong w what's listed on the menu. \nDef a must try!!!!","10832":"This was my first time trying rolled ice cream, it was really good ! It was cool watching it be made and the quality of the ice cream was good. The service was a little off, wasn't sure if they were open or not, but I will definitely come back to try a different flavor.","10833":"What a cool experience! I surprised my boyfriend with this for his birthday and it did not disappoint. The staff was incredibly friendly and our server made us feel very comfortable in a reality that was anything but within a seeing persons normal. Being in the room your other senses increase. As our server would bring the food or beer the first thing I noted was the smell. Usually secondary when food is brought to the table. We both chose to be surprised by our meals and in doing so found we really enjoyed foods neither of us normally would have picked off a restaurant menu. Great experience. Room for improvement would just be the waiting room it's big and has lots of seating but looks very dated. Overall great experience and I've recommended it to many friends and family.","10834":"Chose this place based on overall reviews and not the recent negative posts. Arrived early & were seated right away. Ordered a Caesar salad, linguini with clams & angel hair tomato basil. Meal was prepared nicely and we both enjoyed our meal alot. Next time, I'd love to try the seabass.","10835":"Do yourself a favor and eat here. It's amazing. They let you try samples before you order and are very friendly! Also they give you a lot of food. I loved the combinations of Chinese and Mexican flavors. I can't believe it took me so long to try this place.","10836":"Worst walmart in Phoenix. I hate that this is the most convenient location for me. Every time I go I leave exhausted, shocked, or irritated. The bathrooms are always a riot-no supplies, gross, etc. I was using the sink while someone was essentially karate chopping and punching the paper towel dispenser. People shopping have approached me or harassed me inside and outside the store. Last time I went it looked like the zombie apocalypse had happened because the parking lot bomb had gone off with carts and trash littered everywhere. There were more carts in parking spots than cars. Also, this particular walmart only has the bare minimum of barely human cashiers open. I've waited 20+ minutes for a quick stop late at night. I think there's just so many people rolling through this store acting like barbaric rabid filthy animals that the store cannot keep up. Avoid at all costs.","10837":"Gord and I like craft beer and have been wanting to check out the Indie Ale House for a while.  We headed there for supper this evening.\n\nThey brew their own beer on site.  There is a store there so you can take home some beer, teeshirts, glasses, etc.\n\nI had a couple Takes Two to Mango.  Gord was more adventurous and tried different ones.\n\nGord ordered Mac & Cheese with smoked pork hock, IPA and curds.  He said it was delicious and he'd get it again.  He scraped the bowl pretty clean.  There were lots of chunks of pork!\n\nI ordered Southern Fried Chicken with fries.  The chicken was delicious!  It was so tender and moist.  And there was a lot of it!  I would soooooo get it again!  There was ranch and hot & honey mustard dipping sauces for the chicken.  The dipping sauce for the fries was a mayo\/ketchup\n\nIt was quite busy when we left about 7ish.\n\nWe'll be back!","10838":"Before I get into the food, the atmosphere is the first thing that catches your eye obviously. It's set up like a cross between a 50's diner and a casino lounge. The waitresses are dressed the part, too. \n\nMy wife and I got there on a Monday morning around 10 and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a booth. And the food... restaurants always claim to have \"huge portions.\" This place lives up to reputation. I ordered a veggie omelet, and was worried it wouldn't be enough food so I added cheese and also planned on splitting my wife's side of Canadian bacon. But then the food arrived. The omelet was enormous. I asked the waitress how many eggs, because most places make their omelets with three eggs. No, Peppermill makes theirs with ten. Yes, ten eggs. And it wasn't just a ridiculous quantity; the quality was good, too. \n\n\nAnother bonus is the wife and I were both able to sub fruit instead of potatoes at no charge. And while the side of fruit wasn't nearly as big as the enormously sized fruit plate, it was still a lot. And freshly cut. Lastly, as if to cement the meal as great even more, my wife's eggs were perfectly poached to her liking. When we come back to Vegas, we will definitely go out of our way to stop here a","10839":"2nd time coming to this location and always great service, This Rainbow location always ensures to carry Fiat filters, which most service centers will not stock. Used to go to The Fiat dealer, but always end up having issues with my vehicle and service. I highly recommend Superior Tire on Rainbow for all your auto service needs, thank you guys for your quick and efficient service, hope to be a customer for many years.","10840":"Great food great service. My wife and I had breakfast here over the weekend - coffee arrived at the table in record time and breakfast followed soon after. \n\nThe portions for \"the bunker\" (corn beef hash) are large enough that we each had a midmorning snack later in the day.\n\nWe've been in a number of times over the years and I've always been glad that we've stopped.","10841":"Honestly, my personal experience there was about 1.5 stars at best, but the place is clean and the rooms are spacious.  They are pet friendly, and they have a nice clean little dog area (on-leash, un-fenced), with clean up bags, and the air conditioning worked. So I'll give it 3 stars because I think there are plenty of disgusting and unsafe places to stay in Vegas, and this isn't one of those.\n\nThe staff was friendly enough, but basically useless.  It is a mini conference center and they let their convention groups completely inconvenience and annoy other guests and are extremely passive about it. They might wander over and quietly close the door to a conference room to keep the noise in, but when the group opens it again, they won't tell them not to do it, and they certainly won't tell them not to take over the entire lobby to do songs and warm up activities or quit hiding the luggage carts in their rooms.  They apologize for problems and then just stand there rather than proactively trying to come up with a solution.  They excelled at blank smiles and standing still.\n\nThe wi-fi signal was weak, totally unavailable in one of our rooms, and in the room that did get a signal, the connection was unreliable and tech support was tedious. The router needed to be rebooted multiple times during our very short stay and getting tech support to reach that realization was a painful process involving long hold times.\n\nI'd rather stay there than sleep in my car, but I definitely wouldn't be back unless I had pets with me, and I'd look at other pet friendly places first.","10842":"Entire order was wrong....no special instructions were read or followed! They offered to remake if i bring them back what i didn't like.  It's not that i didn't like it - u made it wrong and i paid for delivery so now i have to go there after 2 days of traveling??  Won't order again!","10843":"Ugh can't get the wet dog smell out of my head. Really?  Have to nuke a piece of nearly paper thin chicken to reheat?\n\nAnd thinking about it the miso was watery as was the thin, strangely colored teriyaki sauce!   $32 lunch ... What a waste!","10844":"Food was ok but the service sucked!! We had to flag down the staff on more than one occasion once to order and once to pay. Both of our entrees were alright, nothing to brag about. It has a nice patio.","10845":"I work in Station Square now so, after 3 weeks, I'm finally stopping by to try their fudge.  I can't believe I've managed will-power this long!\n\nOMG!  They had several to choose from -- all made here.  Once I saw the sign for dark chocolate with caramel and sea salt atop the fudge itself, that's all I needed to see.  I sampled (like I wasn't gonna like it?) then purchased a 1\/2 pound plus a bit to finish off a row being sliced.  That and a diet coke came to about 10 bucks.  Expensive?  I dunno; don't care.  It is wicked decadent and a danger to my lunch hour.\n\nOh, yes... they have ice cream, Sarris candies, gum, mints, cold bottled sodas. too.","10846":"From a girl who was spoiled by NYC bagels for 20+ years, I have yet to find a better bagel in AZ.  Einsteins, Lox, Stox, Chompies and most other are chewier and tougher, but Big City, is simply a big, soft bagel the way God intended it.  It's a small, straight-forward, no-frills store, hardly a wait, nice people, low prices and they just make the damn bagels right.  You should try it if you like bagels. \nIf you enter the shopping center from Hayden Rd. you'll find it right away, as the store is on the back side of all the stores on Pima; roughly behind Staples.","10847":"My friend and I decided Applebee's would be the place for lunch.  Been a lot of places to eat in my life, but the manager \"Benjamin\" at the restaurant impressed me.  Most places when you say you would like to move, because the area where you are sitting is to cold.  Back to your vehicle to get a sweater or  you move to another section.  No, he told us to stay where we were and in about 3mins we would feel a difference.  Not only did he do that, but he came back later and sat with us for a few moments to see if we were okay.  Job well done Sir.  Liked that waiter let us know that they were a little busy, it would be just a little bit for the food, but it didn't really take that long.  When we did received our food,  it was hot and delicious.  I would definitely go back to this particular Applebee's!","10848":"Wonderful place for nails. Erica is a perfectionist - your nails will look their absolute best. Reasonably priced,  clean,  and friendly.","10849":"Told is it would be an hour wait, it took 2. They blamed it in how busy they were (which is understandable) However the center council was dirtier than when we dropped it off and we spent $50. We will not be back.","10850":"I had brunch here last Sunday and I would have to say that the Rib-eye steak was awesome. A perfectly cooked medium rare with soup ,appetizer platter and dessert buffet  for around $24 is a pretty awesome deal for me. The service was very good. The meat is most likely not \"PRIME\" cut but for the price it was delicious. This experience this time around was way better. I would definitely eat here again.","10851":"My husband and I recently remodeled a home we bought about three years ago.   Our contractor suggested checking out Diamond Kitchen and Bath.   Marty Moorehead took care of us and did a great job.   He was very thorough and came out and measured everything.  We bought cabinets for the kitchen and two bathrooms. \n\nThe cabinets look amazing.   There was a door that was warped and a pantry drawer took some damage in shipping.   Diamond immediately got replacements ordered.   We couldn't be happier.   (We love the soft glide drawers). \n\nI highly recommend Diamond Kitchen and Bath and Marty Moorehead.  (And English Building Company)","10852":"I have had my a\/c checked every year for 30 + years, usually via SRP's Certified Contractor Program, and usually they are just great.  But this company made me say WOW ... Kendall is just a dynamo and gave me a lot of good suggestions to keep my unit humming along.  He also made me laugh and said the squash that my son wouldn't eat was delicious - HA!  Seems like a great company - definitely have them on speed dial in case anything happens.  Thanks for the great service!","10853":"Observations from the other night:\n  * The tzatziki was the best I've ever had!\n  * The chicken in my pita was dry.\n  * The gyro meat was pretty good.\n  * The lemon potatoes were okay.\n  * The salad was blah.\n  * The service was friendly and helpful.\n\nI'm rounding up from a 2.85 to 3 stars. I'll have to come back some time and give it another go though. Seems like this place could go either way (good or bad), and I want to be sure if I like it or not. Right now, I'm just not that sure.","10854":"Big fan of the burgers here, double double Animal style all day, with fries and a chocolate shake. Drive thru is always slammed and even if you go inside you are still going to wait 5-10 mins for most orders, I think it's worth the wait, but if you are in a rush, head somewhere else","10855":"I love Q Bistro! The bulgogi kimbab is awesome and so is the LA Kalbi, great place to hang out with friends.","10856":"I love it here!  The staff is super friendly, and the drinks are SO good - my favourite is the watermelon with tapioca.\nThe only reason I didn't give five stars is because it takes a really long time to get your order. I went in and got a drink for take out, just one drink, and it wasn't busy, and it took at least 10 minutes.","10857":"Cheap, clean, well maintained and good service. For crying out loud, it's a storage unit what more could you want! Easy to get to, easy to get in and out. The units don't leak and there seem to be no roaches. Nice managers to deal with. Good web site and email follow up. Name is hokey tho!","10858":"While visiting a friend in Montreal, I was craving pastries and sweets my whole time there.  I've been searching for a good dessert place in Montreal, and finally came across Olivier Potier on my way to Museum of Fine Art. \n\nIt tops everything I've tried in Montreal. I went there on three different days, and each day they had all new pastries to try. Very good bread as well; and their chocolate croissants are worth talking about. AMAZINGGG!!!!!! Make sure you go early in the day, or all the good pastries will be gone!!!!!!! \n\nWish they would open a location in Toronto. One of my favorite pastry shops and bakery!","10859":"We sat at the bar and only had a couple of drinks. The bar service was excellent. We observed the manager making good on an incorrect food order, offering to make it right. Really good service. We will be back.","10860":"love. love. love.\nmitchells is a cleveland staple in my opinion.\ncreamy, rich goodness.\nwaffle cones. um. warm. vanilla. touch of cinnamon, maybe?! \nfav choices: peanut butter pretzel yogurt. ahhhhhh it's like heaven in your mouth.\nbanana pie. what could be better than pieces of pie crust floating around in banana ice cream?! no. really???? \ni love that they are open later than most places, especially when that late night ice cream craving kicks in. \ni love that there are locations all over cleveland! \nmitchells, you get an A+ from me!","10861":"Really enjoyed my visit here. As an Earl Grey lover I was hesitant about trying it as an ice cream  but I was pleasantly surprised it very refreshing.  The bergamont flavor came through nicely. We ordered the turtle pastry and I had to try the earl tart which consisted of an earl grey infused mousse it was excellent. Creamy and decadent.  Ditto for the turtle tart which was our favorite.  Service was prompt and friendly. Location is quaint..not much seating is available though.","10862":"I called at about 5:20 to see if they could get me in for a full set. A man picked up the phone. I inquired about my services and he and his minions busted out laughing in the background as if they were laughing at me asking about a full set. I told him I could be there in 10 minutes, he says\" Uh, how bout twenty?!?\" as he and his minions were still cackling in the background...how unprofessional and rude.\n\nYou're not the only nail shop open until 7 in the area!\n\nI didn't even bother going...they let me know they weren't about shit right over the phone. I ended up going to Hollygood Nails. My full set was complete within 40 minutes and they were extremely professional and clean.","10863":"Spent over $30 trying to order a new 52 comic book with a hard cover from this store. I attempted to cancel this order via phone today during business hours with nobody answering at all, three weeks after placing this order with nothing to show for it. When I arrived to the store in person to cancel the request, they claimed it could not be done; their reasoning was nobody would ever buy the hard cover of this book, at a COMIC BOOK store. This comment was than followed up with the idea of getting a fraction of the money back as store credit...\n\nGot the same hardcover book for 12 dollars on Amazon in two days.\n\nMy bank agreed, I had every right to not process the transaction due to lack of service, and it was canceled on my behalf and determined to be fraud.","10864":"This place is awesome! Ordered many things off the menu and they were all delish! Very fresh and homemade! I am vegan and gluten free and this place is the bomb!!!! I highly recommend it. My new fave!!!","10865":"I ordered the classic chili cheese dog, minus bun. I'm a fan of the fried hotdog, however they really need to look into a better cheese to use. I would try one of the other many styles of hotdogs they have. They do also have good fries.","10866":"Jersey Solar has apparently left town.  Their phone numbers either return a busy signal or indicate not in service.  Emails are returned as undeliverable. They took their APS monitoring system with them as my system does not indicate it is producing power.","10867":"Yum. Our fav restaurant in Charlotte, now in Fort Mill!  Maybe not as much character as the original location, but I'll settle for close to home and much more space. \n\nIn our first visit to this location, we had great service and great food. What more could you ask for?  The manager\/owner came around to check on tables which is a dying art in restaurants today. \n\nThey always have wonderful specials, so definitely ask your server. And order the mac n cheese. Best in Charlotte!","10868":"We will be back, as my girlfriend is southern, and the menu made her gasp in that cute Alabama way she has.  Stopped for a quick bite- fried green tomato BLT with pork belly- five stars.  But two pathetically weak and watery tanqueray and tonics brought this review down to 4 stars- will give them another, larger shot soon.","10869":"I came into the French Grocery during the first day of their soft opening. They were almost sold out of pastries, but their kitchen was furiously prepping lunch. I'm looking forward to great things coming from the French Grocery. I'm very excited that a new grocer is back, and hopefully can produce great food to keep the crowds consistently coming back for more.","10870":"Came here for breakfast Saturday morning on a whim and I was not pleased. Orders were placed and I received the wrong hash. When the waitress came over I told her, but she didn't really respond she just kind of walked away to check what she entered into the system. She comes back and says she rang it in correctly and wasn't sure why I had received the wrong item. She was nice overall even though that interaction was a little weird. The food came out relatively fast after she put in the right order. When I did receive my food, it was fine at first but I saw the eggs were so scrambled it seemed as though there were no eggs at all or maybe they weren't cooked all the way because the entire dish was just wet. Usually eggs are noticeable in any hash, this one was just covered in cheese and the potatoes were also greasy.  I also ordered the Spanish latte which was just ok (it's not really fair to compare real cuban coffee to an American cafe I guess). My dining experience here lead to an entire day of an upset stomach and feeling lethargic. I wouldn't come back to try anything else unfortunately.","10871":"Now there is a problem plaster cracking and cool deck breaking up after just 2 years  now desert springs don't want to answer emails","10872":"Wonderful variety in the beers, constantly refreshed selection, quick responsive staff and some delicious beer\/combos make this the best beer bar in Toronto. Even something as simple as their yam fries is delicate and yummy. A number of beer-infused dishes let you experiment with brewed food flavours. You'll find something like 35 draft beers on tap, plus dozens more in bottles, so even the most demanding beer connoisseur will find something to satisfy their palate. Most highly recommended. \n\nThe only drawback is that it's not a large space so it gets crowded quickly, especially since it's become very popular lately.","10873":"So far the only place that I've tried that was good. Been searching for a year since I moved for a good place. Overall happy. I got the garlic chicken and Mongolian sizzling chicken. Delicious. Plus it's quiet and the staff are great.","10874":"We are locals that had started enjoying Toast (and bragging about it to other locals) on a fairly regular basis.  We had enjoyed great meals just about every time we visited.  However, like other posters, it was confusing to have three or four people coming by the table.  Also, one reviewer referred to the female manager as 'a bitch'.  That's a bit stronger word than I would have used, but I knew immediately who she was talking about.  During our last visit many months ago, my wife's hamburger that was ordered medium rare was delivered with a cold, bleeding center.  No big deal, we flagged down one of the multiple people that had visited our table and asked them to cook it a bit more.  We were very reluctant to do this because it had boursin cheese on top and we just didn't know how it would come back.  It came back medium well with no pink in the center.  The aforementioned female manager came by to see how things were and we expressed our disappointment.  She explained to us that the cook had recently moved here from New York and '...he was still learning how to cook for people in North Carolina.'  Huh?  After this comment sank in for a few minutes, it got me a bit ticked off.  My wife and I have both eaten in New York plenty and they cook meat the same way we have requested it all over the country, including North Carolina.  The manager also told us that she checked the burger when it was first sent back and that it was cooked the way it was ordered.  Well, admittedly, we asked for medium rare and that isn't a long way from rare, but we got extra rare.  Anyone would have sent that burger back, I think.\n\nSo, according to this 'manager', either the cook prepared the burger correctly and we were wrong, or we were idiots from North Carolina that didn't know how to order our food, as far as we could tell.  Since that visit, we have never returned and we will not go back as long as that woman is there.  We have stopped bragging about the place and now, instead, relate our last experience.  Others have shared similar opinions with us.  Recently, at Christmas in Davidson, we were cruising the food vendor tents and saw her manning the Toast tent.  Too bad, we would have loved to pick up something there, but there was no way I was going to give that woman any of my money.\n\nGreg S.","10875":"This is a beautiful place that was tastefully done. They put a lot into the decor.\nHowever they also should have put some time and effort into the food they serve. Ho hum menu with all the basics just doesn't cut it.\nThe Salmon, Roast Chicken are so average and boring without much flavor.\nThe same roasted vegetable with every entree. No bread served with entrees either. \nService is ok but not up to par. Servers seemed inexperienced.\nThis place is like a whole lot of others. Mediocre. It just not worth a return trip. It seems like they all care about their Cocktails programs and not the food!!","10876":"Decided to try something new and was extremely disappointed. We ordered the hummus for an appetizer and it was only mediocre. I ordered the chicken sandwich and it just wasn't quite as well throughout out as it should have been. The roll was too thick so it overpowered the other ingredients. Additionally it was missing something...needs avocado and\/or bacon. My date ordered the mac-and-cheese with chicken and it was dry with little chicken; she was extremely disappointed. I had at least hopped for some good craft beer but nothing outside of the more mainstream \"craft\" brews. We won't be back.","10877":"Dafne Jimenez....guuurrrll! These lashes are everything! I was nervous because this is my first time getting lashes. Not nervous about getting them though, nervous because I have to clue how to take care of these amazing lashes  But Dafne took her time making my lashes look beautiful and talked to me about caring for them, which definitely made me feel very comfortable. Not only are her facials amazing....she truly has magical hands.....but these lashes are making me feel all kinds of sexy!!!  Thank you so much Dafne!! You are absolutely amazing","10878":"My favorite place for hot schezwan soup.  $18 is a lot to pay for a bowl of soup but this is worth it.","10879":"Certainly NOT the best fried chicken I've ever had. \n\nPlus it's overpriced by about 2 times...$26 for fried chicken....I mean come on. \nWho are they trying to hustle?\n\nOh wait a minute....they're trying to hustle us.","10880":"We have been in Verona for about a year now.  We have brought our children here and liked the food.  Recently we are remodeling our kitchen and eat here about once a week.  We happen to like sitting near the bar area for our kids to watch the fish and we can watch the Brewer game. We do not sit at the bar and our children are fairly well mannered. Tonight we were asked to leave the bar area and our children would be best seated somewhere else. Very disappointed in our service this evening.","10881":"This place is great, purchased a hot tub there a few yrs back and would again. The husband and wife owners are always friendly and helpful along with their staff. Have had a few normal wear 'n tear problems with my tub as its over 5 yrs old now but Ryan the service guy\/owner is always quick to service and rates are always fair. Super helpful with advice and locally owned. They care about their reputation and you can tell. Judge for yourself and give them a shot if you're in the market for a hot tub or service call.","10882":"I think reading all the hype may have bolstered this place to such lofty expectations that I was bound to be let down by reality.  While I wasn't let down, I can't give it 5 stars.  \n\nOverall the food was good and the service was awesome but unfortunately, now that I've had the best steak of my life (Wallister Stube in Lake Louise), nothing else quit lives up to comparison even this tender, juicy, perfectly seared tenderloin.  \n\nThat said, the place is definitely worth a visit.  I would stay away from the oysters as an appetizer though as it was too salty but the seared scallops?  The bomb!  And the tomato salad was refreshing and cleaned the palate before the steak arrived.  \n\nI tried something called a Canadian Apple for a cocktail and these people are serious about their alcohol.  It almost knocked me on my tush.  Worth every penny.","10883":"Was driving around Vegas with a friend from Torrance who was kind of homesick.  We decided to try this Korean place.  It was around 8:00 pm on a Saturday night and the place was mostly deserted.  We thought it might be closed, but the door was unlocked so in we went.  The decor was kind of old and cheesy.  It reeked of BBQ and the floor was properly greasy like most Korean BBQ places, so we decided to stay.  The service was adequate.  They only served Korean and American beer.  I asked my friend what he'd like, but he couldn't make up his mind.  We settled on standard fare:  Bulgogi and Kalbi, Kim chee jigae and Hite beer.  Overall the food was just OK, nothing to get excited about.  Banchan were below par in my opinion.  Overall, just an OK meal.  However, when the bill came I was shocked.  Over $100 for that meal?   I paid and left.  The food was just fair, the price was way too much.  Now I know why the place was mostly empty.  I don't know Las Vegas that well, but I'm sure there are other Korean places there that don't charge so much.","10884":"Pizza is one of my favorite foods. Amazing experience. It was so much fun to choose my own toppings, flavors, etc. The pesto sauce is delish. Like subway but with pizza. Excellent service, and friendly atmosphere.","10885":"Went to this spot to order some takeout.  Ordered an Enchilada and Taco combo, both beef, along with other items for the family.  The taco, which normally has a crispy shell, was thrown into the enchilada sauce.  The person bringing us our order did not check to ensure order accuracy.  I was upset about the taco being soggy and gross, and went on to the enchilada, and it was chicken instead of beef.  Two strikes in one menu item.  The family got chimichangas, which were alright but were also sitting in a thick puddle of water.  \n\nTheir to go boxes are those that you would recieve an elementary school lunch in- styrofoam with segments.  The beans were thrown into one segment and the rice into another, allowing for cross contamination.  I'm pretty sure the beans should be in a separate container, at the very least.\n\nBottom line, don't order takeout from here.  They don't take the time to ensure order accuracy, and they are not equipped with the proper boxes to handle takeout to begin with.","10886":"Babymoon gave me an amazing experience right from the beginning. They are well organized from financing to the classes they offer to the delivery process. I felt so empowered with the knowledge they provided to me and my partner, and I'm so thankful I chose Babymoon to take me through this adventure. \n\nThe staff and esp. the midwives are AMAZING and made me feel so comfortable and confident with the entire process. \nSomeone was always available to answer any questions, and they never made me feel like I was inconveniencing them. They took time to get to know me and my family, and never failed at making us feel special when we walked in the door. \n\nMy partner especially loved that he was so involved and encouraged\/empowered throughout the entire process. Not like he experienced with his first child in the hospital. He even got to catch his daughter and got skin to skin time with her at the nest. \n\nFrom the moment out daughter was born she didn't leave our sight, and barely left our arms (to weigh and measure her was the only time, and was done right next to us). \n\nWe are so thankful for Babymoon and would recommend and encourage parents to be to birth with this center.","10887":"This nursery school used to have a good reputation but things have gone downhill under new management.   They are at 186 Morrison after having to find a new location.   I have found some staff to be abrasive and loud with the children.   Very little educational base.... My child learned more at home than here.  For the brief time she attended, there was a terrorist threat which was so scary (it's in a religious building) and an exceeding amount of dangerous stairs difficult for smaller kids to maneuver.  Wouldn't recommend this option with so many other quality choices nearby.","10888":"After a long day of travel, just wanted a cold beer and snack.  This took care of our wants.  Tuesday special... $4.75 steins (had to be 24+ oz or more) and chicken wings $6 for 10 wings.   Small wings, but being from Buffalo, flavor was very good. Philly cheesesteak was flavorful.  Fries were outstanding.  Mark, the bartender, a delight to chat with.  When asking for suggestions, he gave honest opinions.  Would go back again.","10889":"Pizza on 40th has okay pizza. It had a fair amount of cheese and sauce which I like, but the crust was tough and chewy and the sauce was a little sweet.  \nIt came with a salad which was decent,  but no homemade dressing.\nThe tiramisu I ordered for dessert was bland, and tasteless.","10890":"The manager of this location is Amazing. He goes above and beyond to make sure you are completely satisfied with your order. I have had special requests and he has ALWAYS filled my requests with no hesitation. Thank you to the manager of this location for your ongoing exceptional customer service.","10891":"Not cosmic, mediocre. How old is that bread? They don't seem to be trying very hard. Shredded mozzarella on an Italian sub?","10892":"Mike 2\/23\/014 a friend told me about this place coming from newyork this is the closest to newyork taste they got a new customer im gonna tell my friends about this place","10893":"Very friendly attentive staff! I will definitely be back!\nToday I had a pedi and gel mani that looks fabulous? Even had live guitar music while I relaxed with the massage chair.\n\nBack again with same results!","10894":"As a Realtor, I strongly recommend Stephen Shefrin Photography. Since Stephen has begun taking my listing photos, I have received exceptional feedback and my listings truly stand out. I have had guests attend my Open Houses because they saw the photos online, thought they were phenomenal, and had to visit the home. I have also been contacted by other Realtors inquiring about who has taken my listing photos. Stephen's talent has transformed my marketing. Additionally, he is prompt, professional, responsive, and provides swift turn-around time.","10895":"The start of the new year also means the start of Happening Gourmand in the old port. This food \"festival\" brings together all the restaurants of the Antonopoulos Group and provides a special reduced price table d'h\u00c3\u00b4te at each of their 8 restaurants. Events like these are enjoyable for me simply because it allows me to try Old Port restaurants without costing me my arm and perhaps a leg to enjoy. Ironically this year, I wasn't a driving force amongst my friends to participate as is usually the case... two separate friends set up two reservations and invited me! I guess this is a sign of the event gaining a foothold in people's consciousness. Either way, I won't turn down a good meal so away I went. The first of the two dinners was at Taverne Gaspar - the Group's Gastropup located on de la Commune with a view of the Saint-Lawrence.\n\nVisually, Taverne Gaspar attempts to blend the pub or tavern look with elements of the old Montreal building it is located in - a nice long wooden bar with wooden seats, leather banquettes and chairs, tile flooring and roofing, low lighting with the exception of the christmas lights set up along the center of the room. That choice along with the use of dark tones elsewhere to put emphasis on the old stone walls creates a very relaxed old world kind of feel. The night we were there the entire street actually lost power so at one point for a bit, the lighting was almost completely candlelight so that intimate feel was cranked up further! Thankfully the lost power didn't affect our meal...\n\nNow, as for the food, the menu is definitely gastropub fare with touches of more local influences. As a group of 3, we each picked something different in order to try as much as we could. First up, a classic onion soup - a hardy and meaty broth with good quantity of onions nicely caramelized topped with gooey cheese and a crouton. Well very executed and enjoyable.\n\nI also had some fresh oysters because I'm a sucker of oysters so if they're on the menu, it's hard for me to resist. Paired with a nice mignonette, there were great.\n\nNext, we had the lobster sliders with house chips. Firstly, when the menu says sliders, we would have expected more than one but no... just one. Thankfully it was pretty flavourful although I would have prefer more lobster versus mayo. The house chips were nicely seasoned with a good crunch. The salad felt like it was there to make the dish seem larger. A solid dish flavour-wise but disappointing in terms of portion - especially when this was a dish where they charged extra for it within the table d'h\u00c3\u00b4te.\n\nThe last starter was their beef poutine with cheese curds and cipollini sauce. In my eyes, this was the best of the bunch. The beef was rich and fall apart in texture and in combination with the cipollini sauce, gave the poutine a much hefty feel than your standard poutine. Add solid fries and the correct cheese curds - melt just a bit but still keep its texture and squeak - and we have a great starter.\n\nMoving on the mains, the first one was their beef bourguignon. Once again great texture to the beef - chewy but fall apart. Carrots and potatoes cooked nicely as well but that reduced sauce was really the key here. Brought everything together and really made the dish nice and hearty - exactly what one seeks in a beef bourguignon.\n\nNext was the mac n'cheese with cheddar and smoked lardons. Baked off nicely in a onion soup dish, the cheddar brought some sharpness to the creamy gooeyness that is mac n'cheese and of course the fattiness of the lardons was well appreciated. A solid dish.\n\nThe last main was the Gaspar BBQ burger with their house fries - another dish where they charged extra for but thankfully in this case it was worth it. Portion-wise this was by far the biggest and enjoyable across the board. More of the house fries plus a side of coleslaw to go with the burger. The beef patty was cooked perfectly topped with some melted cheese, bacon and slaw. A little spicy mayo was provided to go with the fries as well. Another solid dish to round off the second course.\n\nFinally, we had the desserts. The table d'h\u00c3\u00b4te provided two options - chantilly brownies and a bumble berry cheesecake. The brownies were decadent and very chocolatey. The chantilly cream provided a nice counterbalance to that. The cheesecake was nice as well - the right level of creaminess without being too rich. Solid way to end our meal.\n\nOverall, Taverne Gaspar was a solid and well executed meal pretty much across the board. I'm not a big fan of how they charge extra on certain dishes within the table d'hote especially when they are some of the more appealing options there but I suppose it was just up to us to not order them. I like the vibe of the setting and the quality of the food on the menu. If one is seeking a worthwhile gastropub in Old Montreal, Gaspar is worth your consideration.\n\nCheers!","10896":"Menu: http:\/\/www.ruelo.com\/ (Includes cakes and macarons list, they have more stuff at the location.)\n\nWhat we had: various flavours of macarons, Ruelo cake, green tea red bean sesame cake, strawberry yuzu cake, white chocolate lemon cake (not listed on their website)\n\nTaste: 10\/10\n\nCan we give 11\/10? We absolutely love their cakes, especially the Ruelo cake. That's our favourite cake in the whole world. It's like Ferrero Rocher made into a super decadent cake. Their cakes are consistent masterpieces and look elegant. Their website has descriptions of the cakes so we will not go into detail in our review. The only cake that we weren't big on was the green tea red bean sesame cake because it was not sweet enough for our taste. If you like a cake that's very light tasting and has low sweetness, you may like the green tea cake.\n \nThe macarons here are good as well; the Ruelo macaron is Laura's favourite. One of the more recent flavours we've tried is the strawberry yogurt, which had the yogurty tartness and was interesting. We really really really want to try the Cream Cheese Orange flavour, but we never see it available in store. :( \n\nValue: 5\/10\n\nNot going to lie, the goods are expensive. Like we've said about the other location: \nThe servings they list on their website are waaaaaaaay off. The small cake is supposed to serve 6-8 people? More like 6-8 mice, and that's being generous. We can each decimate a 5' mango almond cake on our own. (Not proud of it, but true facts.) That being said, their cake prices are cheaper and tastier than Nadege, and their single serving cakes are not too expensive (around $6, forget exact price). \n\nService\/Convenience: 8\/10\n\nThis location is in Time Square, and if you've been there, you know that finding parking is almost impossible. Once you manage to find parking, finding the store front is easy. We never tried their afternoon tea thing, but from the times we bought cakes and macarons, the staff here are very friendly and efficient.\n\nWhen we came here to get Laura's bday cake, the staff did not have a cake available but they were very accomodating; they were able to assemble the cake in 15 minutes.\n\nWould go back? Yes, this is Laura's go-to cake store for special occasions. \n\nWould recommend to friend? Yes, the cakes, and macarons if the friend is into macarons.\n\nSimilar places: Nadege Patisserie","10897":"If you need a quick Chinese food fix and are on a bit of a budget, then this place is perfect for you.

A must try if you haven't  I had the Kangnam dog and the angry kimchi fries and both are delish!!!","10899":"I am building a home in Peoria and moving away from Southern California. I was in need of a color and cut, and knew I had to start locating a new stylist. Being in my sixties, I knew this was not an easy task, coupled with the fact I wanted to cut my hair short for lower maintenance.\n\nAfter conducting research on Yelp, I found Tonia. I called, and immediately was impressed from the start. I set up the appointment, and was not sure if I was ready for a new hairstyle. My fear was looking like the woman my age who have short hair and look matronly and frumpy. \n\nUpon meeting Tonia, I found her to be a beautiful, funny, smart, and interesting woman; it would be easy to sit in a chair in her presence for a few hours. I discussed my hesitant desire to cut my hair short. She asked me several questions (a subtle interrogation I learned, as she is no dummy---not smart to cut someones hair off short and be dealing with a freaked out customer whom she does not know...:-) Voila!  I went short, and I LOVE MY HAIR! She gave a precision cut that fit my style and face, and I have never had so many compliments on my hair. She is a truly skilled stylist (also with color), and I am grateful I was able to locate a new one who is so talented, and a joy to be around. After all these years, I have moved around alot with stylists, and loved my current one. It was dreadful to leave her, but I was blessed to have located Tonia. She is truly a professional, reasonable, and aims to please! You will not regret using her!","10900":"You get what you pay for.  In this case you pay a little for a better product.  Love this place.  Food quality and heartiness is far above most.","10901":"I'm continually amazed that people think that China, with its 8 regionl cuisines and varied biomes and some dozen odd ethnic minorities , will always have the same stir fried beef with broccoli and done the way they had it in New York or whatever American Chinese eatery they had growing up.  Please people, this restaurant serves east northern ( dong bei) homestyle wheat based dishes.  They may have some of the American Chinese dishes on the menu but that is  for the clueless diner that wandered  in wantingpork fried rice and egg fo young for  chinese dishes and not what they specialize in.  Please read Jennifer 8's great book on Chinese reataurants and you can undestand what the differences are.  \nThis restaurant does decent and tasty dumplings, green pancakes, breads, buns (man tou)'etc,.  More homestyle but still tasty.  Does it measure up to the best of SGV, MontereyPark, Rowland Hts, ? No.  But its decent and its tasty and I applaud them for opening up here in AZ.","10902":"Quite a charming place to dine! Think of paradise bakery...but way better! Excellent house coffee. I look forward to visiting again :)","10903":"This place. I had heard about it being a staple in the Vegas community when I lived here last year, and I'm glad I got to try it! The food was incredible and GREAT portions for the price. The decor is perfectly Vegas. The lounge was beautiful! The place was packed but I called ahead for.my Party of 14 and we were seated 20 minutes after arrival.\n\nOur table's favorite dish next to the giant pancakes was the Sin City BLT that came with an overeasy egg and pesto sauce. Please try this place on your next trip!","10904":"This was my first professional teeth whitening experience & I'm not going to lie.. I was super nervous. I have super sensitive teeth from over whitening with store bought strips & was afraid that the process would make my teeth hurt. It was the exact opposite! Not only does True Teeth Whitening  break down every step to you, but they also use natural products that actually builds your enamel instead of harming it... I think that's pretty awesome ! I'm sooooo stoked on the out come & I CAN'T stop smiling","10905":"Check out Mary Lou Coady at the Beauty Boutique in this Shoppers Drug Mart.  She is what makes this yelper rereview this location at 5 stars.\n\nI needed last minute shopping ideas before my Christmas party on Christmas Eve, and we all know how busy stores can be.  Well Mary Lou knows her store inside and out, she gave me 3 or 4 ideas for affordable gift items for the last members on my Christmas list plus the personalised service needed to feel like I was the only client in the store.  \n\nShe actually brought me down a couple of different aisels outside of the Beauty Boutique  to show me some gift ideas which were on sale in places that I would have missed if I didn't know where to look.\n\nI got a great Clinique gift set for my cousin, which included a lotion, make-up removal, lippy, mascara, eyeshadow set and body wash for only $35.  And not only that it came in this ubber classy white and silver bag which she could use to go shopping or even use at an elegant dinner date, it was that nice.\n\nMary Lou has got me hooked to come back for other gift ideas at the local Shoppers, who would have thought?","10906":"The girl was friendly and the rooms are clean but they're also very small and this hotel is very close to the street, is right next to the freeway and sounds like its directly underneath the landing path for the Charlotte Douglas airport.\n\nIt will not be a quiet night.\n\n2013 #183 \/ 365","10907":"Best icecream ever!\nWould definitely recommend this to everyone.\n\nThey got tons of unique ice cream flavors.\n\nMy favorite is their grasshopper mint!","10908":"Life changing food. There are not any other words that can describe the experience. The food was hot, seasoned and delicious. Worth a flight just to eat and drink here. Service was beyond expectations. Will be back with friends.","10909":"My car was due to be ready at 2. It is now almost 6. I kindly asked ONE time for an eta and was YELLED AT AND CURSED AT in front of a crowded lobby for all to hear. Then the mgr justified it by saying that the detail tech has been under a lot of stress and walked away. SHOCKING. Danny's has lost another loyal customer. \nAnthony has a MAJOR anger mgmt problem. And his mgr Jordan appears to be totally fine with his his employee treating women (or anyone) that way.  These people are scary thugs.","10910":"We love their double decker pizza! They are always spot on when they give the pick up time. 3rd time back and no complaints. Keep up the good work!","10911":"The gyro sandwich is very good.  The pita is soft and fresh, the lamb meat is flavorful and tender, and the lettuce and tomatoes seem fresh and looked good.  The fries are served very hot, medium salt level, and on the light side (i.e., not fried to a dark, golden color).\n\nThey are cash only, which is a limitation in 2017.  And the setting, while quite clean, is kinda of dark and small and not super inviting.","10912":"So I left a review a long time ago for take out and I can't believe I haven't updated it. Bahn Thai is still just as amazing! It ended up turning a once week spot for lunch every week for almost a year! Pineapple fried rice is amazing! Gaeng Mussamun is also amazing. Almost everything on that lunch menu is amazing. Even their Japanese food options and sushi is great! Ask for Mary! She's great!!","10913":"They had fast service and the staff was very attentive. The food was good too. We got the all you can eat which was perfect and the pricing wasn't bad for it. They are also 24 hours which is a plus.","10914":"The sign says they open at 7am, but apparently they overslept today hahaha. Two stars for sleeping in!","10915":"My husband and I used this wonderful company for our new home. (Just moved to NV.) Keeping it simple, he's quick and good with his work. Very happy with our water softener, and our instant hot water. Got no issues from the beginning so I give them full five stars. Thank you so much again.","10916":"We had NO expectation with their food when we walked in here. We were just tired, hungry, and wanted some Asian food to fill us up. We thought their food cannot be compared with the authentic Asian food in NYC. \n\nHowever, it was SO YUMMY! \n\nFirst thing that impressed us was their beef noodles soup. Beef was tender, soup was tasty, not too salty. \n\nWe ended up almost going there every day during our stay in Vegas. And we figured the best dish was still beef noodles soup after trying other dishes. \n\n\nMust order: Beef Noodles Soup with a little spice!","10917":"this is a nice addition to the downtown core, being pros and all and there couldnt be a more perfect spot.  do a little jewish exercising then eat a little jewish food.  l'chaim!\n\nso theyve set up this smaller version of bagel world here with a nice cushy seating area and like the other reviews state, you can get great, fresh, big bagels and fill them with really fresh tasting and fresh looking ingredients.\n\nwhen i was there i jumped on getting the awesome rugalech which are essentially rolled up small pastries that are filled with chocolate, jam, cinnamon, but chocolate is the best in my opinion.  what i regret not getting was their bubka which IS SICKENING!!!!!!!!!.  imagine a tasty egg bread (challah) filled with chocolate goo and chocolate chips and sprinkled with little bits of sugary dough.  words suck. i cant possibly describe how awesome this is.   lets just say i would take this dessert over any dessert i have ever tried in my life - over any cheesecake, over any apple pie (no contest even), over cookies, candies, even chips (love the chips).\n\nin addition to all the above goodies you can get prepared stuff like little tubs of tuna that are super expensive (9 bucks) and also great jewish treats like latkes, bourekas, etc.  \n\nFinally, i think the flat bagels are the booyah baby, because, in my family, ive always hollowed out the bagel and stuffed stuff inside it, so the flat bagels get rid of all that extra bread but still have the crispy, chewy goodness of bageldom and you can still feel a little jewish too.","10918":"Good coffee, but the patrons are all either very snobbish or just loud kids hanging out on the sidewalk. And the live music usually sucks pretty badly.","10919":"This was the 1st chiropractor I have ever been to.  I was skeptical, but my wife has seen Dr. Nemanic many times.  I wish I would not have waited so long.  Several months ago I walked in, 1st time, with a very sharp pain in my upper back.  I walked out 15 minutes later completely pain free.  I swear it was like a miracle.  I had a pinched nerve, a deep breath, a relaxation of your fear, a quick twist, and I floated out of his office.  Whoa.  I have recently returned for a pain associated with putting a roast in the oven (good greif).  Not such a quick fix this time as I have more than a pinched nerve, this is an injury requing some rest and a little more consultation.  I like Dr. Nemanic's explanations, great anecdotes, sense of humor and really he's just very matter of fact. \nI have always walked in (not made an appointment) and been seen within 30 minutes.","10920":"It's on Mt. Washington, but no view.  The inside looks like a fire hall set up for a wedding.   It is so loud that I sometimes can't hear my dinner partner across the table.  But none of that matters when you taste the food.  The pasta is outstanding, and served in enormous, enormous portions.  The menu is a bit cryptic - dishes aren't really described, only named, so make sure you know what you're getting before you order.  \n\nAnd it's BYOB, so don't forget your wine!","10921":"I can't say enough about Bill and his staff.  He was constantly checking in on me and making sure I understood the process and his strategy.  From day 1, I felt like Bill cared about me personally and how the results would impact me.  I only witnessed professionalism from Bill and his staff.  Every call was promptly returned and every one I worked with seemed to have my best interest at heart.  I was referred to Bill by a friend and I would absolutely refer him to my friends.  He is a well respected attorney in Charlotte and NC and I just experienced why...... thank you Bill and team for the WIN!!!!!","10922":"Good store with a very helpful staff. I have unfortunately needed to come in twice on the last week. I experienced trouble with both of my vehicles. \n\nFirst problem was a dead battery with my Nissan. Couldn't find a single store which had my battery in stock, not even the AAA truck. My battery was so old it would not hold a jump once my headlights were turned on. Got to the store right before closing, the guys stayed late to find me a battery that would work with my vehicle. I am incredibly please with the service Greg and the other gentlemen in the store provided me with. \n\nSecond problem. The ac stopped blowing in my 04 civic. Having received such good service earlier in the week I thought I would bring it back for at least a diagnostic. The gentlemen who assisted me was very polite and helpful. Turns out I just needed 1 part replaced. It was all done in the same trip and now my AC is even colder than before. \n\nI will say today I learned they are not very speedy. I know these repairs can take a while, I would just prefer a better estimate on how long I will be waiting. However I am pleased with their work and the service i receive.","10923":"Love it... Love it, love it. \nI've gone to this restaurant three or four times now, and each time I try something different and each time I enjoyed the food and experience.","10924":"Great happy hour and tacos ... a definite stop for after work margaritas.","10925":"Golden Days Bakery is family operated, tasty, and fair priced! Check them out! :) I've had cakes made here and they are amazing! Super talented bakers for sure! They always have the cutest cookie designs too! I've also heard their pies are at Gus's Diner in Sun Prairie too! Yum!","10926":"Came here to get my son's haircut, walked in an stood there for 10 mins before I was even greeted. Then someone finally walks up, well actually they were walking out of the salon and asks are you here for a haircut? I said yes for my son and then they say something in Spanish to another stylist  and then says to me they have no one avail to cut hair. Never suggests a time to come back or asks if I'd like to schedule an appt for later or anything and then just walks out. First impression of this place was a bad impression and I won't be back..","10927":"I love Hanks ! The environment is very elegant and beautiful and the food is fabulous. My overall experience was amazing .. Cocktails are spectacular,as well as the food ! I can't say enough ... Wld recommend to any of my out of town clients and my local friends .","10928":"This is real east coast pizza with fresh real ingredients. The sausage is made from scratch and the dough on the pizza is out of this world. We live in Henderson and this pizza is so good worth the trip. He does delivery to Henderson as well but we love going in. The owner is always happy to see us and it is such a great feeling knowing how he really cares about what he serves and the service. This place is wonderful. I would give it 100 stars if I could.","10929":"Dr Brown was great. Friendly and helpful. Explained everything and even threw in a little podiatrist humor! His staff was great too. My foot is so much better. Will be going back.","10930":"I thought as a treat for my hubs I would take him to sushi, I'm not a huge sushi fan as I don't eat fish. I was wrong, it turned out to be a treat for both of us. Every dish we had was delicious and unique. Lots of gluten free options for me as well. Will for sure go again when were in Vegas next.","10931":"Super good coffee here!!! We got the baclava (pecan) and the frost (blended\/cold) white & black. Super good and a really cute relaxing back patio with fountains and shade trees as well as shades areas and power outlets by the tables.","10932":"Short ribs were really good, they have a little kick to them. Loved, loved the chicken parmesan - not too bready","10933":"Awesome sandwiches for great value. Spacious seating for our daughter. Perfect lunch spot after visiting the railroad park!","10934":"Went here for lunch with the family.  We got the flatbread pizza, shrimp poboy and the burger.  Everything was great but our favorite was the burger and fries...WOW!!!!  Probably one of the best burgers we've ever had.  Environment was upscale (I don't dress trendy enough to fit in there, haha) and staff were friendly and responsive.  We'll be back","10935":"I've made about four visits to Cravings the last couple of times I was in Vegas, lunch and dinner.  Some were planned, some weren't.  All visits were positive.\n\nThe food selection is great.  They have a great salad bar.  They also have a bar with some TVs.  There's a seafood section towards the back and also a noodle section that serves wonton and Pho.\n\nThere is also the meats and pizzas and all the other misc stuff.\n\nIf you have not been there, give Cravings a try.","10936":"Been here a few times on our many visits to Vegas, plus I love staying at the Rio, staff is very friendly, food is good, can say that I haven't been disappointed, this last time I got an Avocado BLT and my bf got a Turkey club, he didn't like that the bacon wasn't fresh, fresh, it's almost 11 when we ordered so he thinks it was from the mornings batch, we also switched out the fries for onion rings (only $1.00 up chance) which isn't bad, but they didn't let them cook enough so the batter was still wet in the inside of the ring. Too bad for us that we brought our food up to the room if not we would have sent them back. \n\nOther then his food, mine was great and because it's not our first time here, we will go back.","10937":"The quoted for 30mins and they got it done less than 20mins. Well it costs me $140, but I'm tired of looking at my crazy screen, so whatever, lol! Great job for whoever fixed it , sorry I didn't get your name.:) . Anyway, you guys made my day. But I really really hope I don't see you guys again.","10938":"Good food alot of it as you would expect from guys.   The mac bacon cheeseburger was delicious.   \nBoo for no military discount.   But very friendly and delicious.","10939":"I am very impressed with Eric at Gemsetter. We approached him having acquired a stone and a ring, and learned a lot about porosity and other issues which are pervasive when getting jewelry on the Internet. \n\nWith Eric's expert advice (and some stone envy), we kept our stone and returned the overly porous setting acquired via the Internet. We went with a setting from Gemsetter's supplier (only $100 more in the end) and wound up with a beautiful engagement ring for my lovely bride-to-be.\n\nIn my opinion, Eric @ Gemsetter is the one stop shop for anyone looking to build their own ring. He is happy to work with stones you bring in, help you find the right setting, and will work around your finances in ways you'd never think possible.\n\nI am so glad we happened upon him in our search for a gem-setter. Henceforth, all jewelry purchases we make from Arizona will come under his advisement; it truly is a remarkable value to know a veteran goldsmith who manages a jewelry shop-- he can tell you anything you want to know about the business.","10940":"This is our go-to place for Thai. Always good, the restaurant has a nice ambience and the food is excellent. I am partial the the Pumpkin Red Curry and always start with their yummy fresh rolls. You can't beat the lunch prices.","10941":"Hands down top notch drinks crafted before your eyes. Great space for a date or to enjoy with friends. Booths are avail amongst plenty of bar seating. \n\nLoved the decor! See if you can spot all the Gremlins that are hidden around the bar =xtra cool. Even the bathroom is decked out in Wu-Tang and hip hop flyers.\n\n1st time here so I asked bartender Sally for her recommendation of a gin based cocktail. She created an elixir -off menu- that should be the establishment's highlighted drink! It was infused with cucumber and was mind blowing.\n\nIf your are in the neighborhood give this place a try it won't dissapoint.","10942":"Wow! The best sushi in LV-hands down!! I've been here many times. The Yellowtail tartare tacos and El Topo roll are fantastic! Lima and Neo Tokyo roll and yellowtail pradita sashimi my choice picks. Service above and beyond-Vanessa is awesome! and patient with my recent visit which had some in our party who are novice sushi goers.","10943":"Great atmosphere, service and bartender. One of the only places that has a dry aged NY strip in town. Everything was perfect and is a great place to go for fine dinning and keeping it local","10944":"I'm really shocked this Panera is only at 2.5 at the time I'm writing this! Panera is my home away from home and where I try to get as many meals as possible when I'm traveling for work. I know the menu and trust the food, and my experience here was just as good as any other location in the many other states I've visited. Service was on par, too. \nTotally satisfied with this place.","10945":"I have been going to Dr Joe for a year now. He is amazing super knowledgeable. He has decreased my hip pain!","10946":"Huge expanse of yarn amazingness. :) The staff are helpful, knowledgeable and nice. It makes me wish I lived in the Valley again so I could be a frequent customer. :)","10947":"I liked THEhotel but didn't love it. Pluses: all the rooms are two room suites (not the jr. suites they have at the venetian where the sitting area is on a platform). I was on the 38th floor -- with a view of the strip -- and that was great. The decor is dark colors and silvers -- very masculine. it's also pretty easy to get a cab from here -- but you are at the end of the strip so expect to be paying money for cabs. Negatives: room service sucked and the bar closes early (but you can go over to mandalay). \n\nOther good thing: the bathouse spa. I've been twice now and it's been consistently great. the gym however is painted red and can get annoying by day 3.","10948":"Just finished dinner at Bottiglia, when ever I come here I enjoy it every time! Kobee was our server for the evening and he really made it a memorable experience. He recommended a great rose and we ended up buying the bottle which entered us into there wine club! The chicken parmesan was my fave!! I love this restaurant!","10949":"The worst night sleep I've ever had. I was in Pittsburgh for an important interview and I thought staying at a Marriott would be a safe bet. \n\nThe room was spacious and well decorated. But there were long hairs in both the sink and shower and had clearly not been cleaned-gross. The curtains were not long enough for the windows and the light shone in all nights because of street lamps right outside. The shower knob also wasn't screwed on and fell on my foot-surprised it's not broken. The air conditioner was SO loud and rattled on and off all night-causing me to wake up too many times to count. It also wouldn't stay on for more than a few minutes at a time and there were just so many noises. \n\nWhen we told the front desk our issues, they just said \"I'm sorry about that\" and nothing to try and rectify our terrible night. We are silver elite Marriott members and stay at Marriotts all the time-but YIKES!!!","10950":"Great food and great service. My boyfriend and I had the pleasure of having Austin as our server. He was so funny and personable. He is definitely an huge benefit to this restaurant. Thank you, Austin.","10951":"This place recently got a facelift!  They added a whole new grocery section and redid the cosmetic area and other parts of the store.  It looks nice now...I have been to nicer Target's but this one is so close and convenient to my house.  It is very easy to get to and the parking lot is large and never too crazy...except for holidays.  I always find everything I need...I love ELF cosmetics and they have plenty of that...the clothing options are decent I have seen more at other Targets but its still good!  I really like their Starbucks in this store.  They always get my drink just right and they always have the cups I want if the Starbucks across the street is sold out.  They have decent prices on groceries and I love the Up and up brand!  I find just as good of deals at Target as I do at Walmart!  I have gotten alot of home decor items here and they always have a great selection.  They have a way better selection here then at the Target in the Pavilions in Scottsdale.  The staff has always been helpful and nice.  It is a great Target!","10952":"I will not stay here ever again!!! Aside from how much you spend on the rooms, when you book and confirm the total they give you will not be the total you have to pay upon checkout! Don't even think about using the fridge in your room as its full of mini bar items that if you even touch you will be charged for. They still tried to charge me for items that I wasn't even close to touching! The room had the most terrible view, the cleaning service was atrocious and on top of that they still over charged me for my room after I kept repeatedly calling to have them fix my bill! For all you pay for a suite here you could save your money and stay anywhere else and actually have a pleasant stay! Usually I stay at the Paris but wanted something special for my boyfriend's birthday...I will never abandon Paris again!","10953":"I recommend Spectrum to all of my friends...everyone who works there is so nice and cordial.  I went in for an initial skin check and had to get some pre-cancerous cells removed shortly after the biopsy...it was kind of scary because I did not really know much about the process, but everyone was so nice and friendly.  I specifically worked with Dr. Stutman and his assistant, Deanna, both were so nice and friendly.  Dr. Stutman has great knowledge and is very personable and made the process easy...I actually looked forward to going back to get my stitches out so that I could chat with him and his staff.  \n\nI will be going to Spectrum for all of my derm needs from now on.","10954":"WORST SERVICE IN TEMPE!!!!! Like the WORST....\n\nHighly understaffed and rude to boot.\n\nFirst off all you'd have to be drunk to enjoy the awful food and since we are having trouble even ordering a drink it's just a miserable experience. \n\nI won't ever be returning to El Hefe for any reason. Even if they were giving away Tequila for free, I'd find another spot to drink. \n\nClearly they make lots of money and the management doesn't care for their customers. \n\nIn a town full of bars there's lots of other good choices to drink and spend your $$$\n\nDon't go to El Hefe!!!","10955":"Since I moved out of the area, I miss a lot about Madison.  One of the things I really miss is Monty's.  I made a point to bring several friends here and their assessment of this diner-gone-upscale was good as well.  The food is diner classics with an updated touch as well as a few things that are probably best described as new American.  The food is excellent, especially the numerous vegan and vegetarian options.  The ambiance is clean and bright; the service good.  The only downsides are that the wait can be long, especially on weekend mornings, and parking is limited.","10956":"Amazing, legit chill spot nothing fancy awesomeness .....good food cheap nice staff. Had meatball sandwich boooomb!!! I'm sure the rest is amazing .","10957":"Have been eating here since it was a hole in the wall next to the old Copenhagen store on shea in the 80's.  It went through several locations and finally got new owners and another  location.  You couldn't find nicer owners than Ruth & Shelley.  They go out of their way to make sure you're happy with your food.  You cant get a better roast beef sandwich anywhere!  Their Bialys are the best!  If you're having a party get their bialy stick sandwich tray.  You can custom order it the way you want with the side dishes to go with it.  YUM!  I finally won my husband over with their burgers, which I would never order, when I can get their small roast beef sandwich on a wheat bialy stick.  He also loves their hopple popple for breakfast.  Also I can take my doggies when the weather's nice and sit on their patio and eat","10958":"The place holds up to it's name with fine foods. The customer service and employee knowledge is also exemplary.","10959":"Overrated is the first word that comes to mind when I think back to my recent meal at Primanti Bros. For the record, this has been hyped up for some time, and it was my first Primanti Bros experience. Honestly I thought the wings were more enjoyable than the sandwich, which was just ok.\n\nI did appreciate that the slaw on top was vinegar based instead of mayo based, which reminded me a bit in flavor of sauerkraut, which would tie back to some German Pennsylvania roots. That aside, the sandwich otherwise was eh. It satisfied but didn't really do much to impress.","10960":"Six of us ate here. The food is great & served hot. That alone impressed me. The waitresses are not assigned to stations so the servers don't get distracted & forget about you. We will be back.","10961":"I came here purely based off of Adam T's recommendation, and my homie did me right. \n\nWhen I hear that there's a great restaurant inside of local casino I tend to call, \"bullshit,\" but Bottiglia Cucina is the real deal. The vibe of this place is bustling, fun and feels \"young\" not old and stuffy, which is where most local spots tend to falter. \n\nBottigula offers a full open kitchen\/dining room, a large outdoor patio, and decent sized bar and lounge area if you're just looking for a few drinks. We showed up early for our reservations stopped at the bar for a quick drink and light bite before the main meal event. The bar is great, and I could have easily eaten dinner here and been happy. We sampled the charred octopus, and a few martinis and both were perfect. The octopus was very tender and just a touch chewy. Once we sat down, we started with Meatballs and Carbonara Mac n Cheese and shared the Braised Short Rib. I don't have one bad thing to say about any of the food, everything came out fast and hot, which is great because they were busy on this night. \n\nOut of everything we ate, I highly recommend the Charred octopus and Braised Short Rib, order these, and you'll walk out a happy camper. I also keep hearing that this place has an excellent Sunday brunch. Time to brunch so hard.","10962":"One of the largest restaurants in Chinatown, the Regency Palace is a great place to go for dim sum, lunch or dinner anytime.... providing that you do NOT go to the buffet and order a la carte.  If you do go to the buffet, the food will be 2 1\/2 to 3 star at best, and compares with most chinese buffets at any other place though with a pretty decent dessert buffet as well.\nBeing the largest, I never have problems finding a table for dim sum, and throughly enjoy the food.  Broken into 3 parts, 1 fixed station for the most popular steamed items, 1 fixed station for the most popular fried items, and the traditional mobile carts comprising the 3rd part, dim sum is efficient, fast and fresh.  \nIn groups of 6 or more, their set menu dinners are fantastic.  At a value of 20-30 a person, a group can have a feast of 7-10 dishes, all freshly made to delight friends and all.  \nOne special note, it's probably the best chinese place in Calgary that can accomodate private groups from as few as 10 to as many as hundreds.  Plenty of small private rooms and even a dance floor with a stage for a live band.","10963":"Omggg so in love w my hair! Sheynna is amazing! And she is so fun to chat with! I came in w crazy roots and uneven highlights and left with beautiful subtle ombre. EXACTLY what I wanted!","10964":"If I could give this 0 stars I would.\nDelivery took an hour. Pizza arrived cold and not prepared as ordered. Sausage is completely unseasoned pork topping.  Gross is the only word I can think of to describe this pizza. Save your money. You'll get better pizza from the frozen food aisle at Giant Eagle.","10965":"Some of the best chicken around. Fish was  good, carving station. Deserts OK, salad bar was pretty good always fresh. Very clean but dated. Workers were very nice and kept things filled. Parking lot is a mess holes everywhere crumbling concrete. I am surprised it was never fixed. Much better than the big chains!","10966":"The things here are a bit on the pricey side, but there are so many cute jars, boxes, stickers, stamps, etc. that you can find here for any and all DIY creations from scrap booking, to card making, sand art, to sewing, to party decorations & so much more. They have deals every week here & when I'm in the store & they've got a good deal, I jump on it! A lot of the staff here are nice & friendly too. They don't know my name but they know my face and almost always know what I'm looking for.","10967":"Very conveniently located off the strip. Very friendly and courteous staff. I especially appreciated the lighter complected black lady with pretty eyes who helped me after I stood in a long line. I didn't have stay long with my couple of items. She went out of her way to ensure I was treated great, I thank you!  :) \n\nI'm not from here, I was just eating over at the Ellis Island and needed a few things to bring back to the hotel room. \n\nI noticed that it was very quick & easy to hail a taxi. Funny thing is, the taxi hailed us!  lol :) \n\nNot a bad experience with this 7\/11.","10968":"I called Jack for our mail key lockout and he was over within a half an hour. He took a lot of time to try and fix the existing lock first to help us out. He charged half the cost of what others quoted. Very nice, quick, efficient and cost effective. Thank you!","10969":"Dan was amazing! He showed us around and really explained what Jojo's had to offer! The jerky is amazing and they offer a bunch of sauces and other delectibles. I really enjoyed the samples and totally recommend checking them out. Thanks Dan for making our experience awesome.","10970":"I've been going here for over five years and it would've been 4\/5 stars- especially with my previous stylists who have since left the country. But what prompted this review is a warning to other guys who may get haircuts from their two new male Korean stylists. \n\nNot sure if it's just me but they have aha it of just driving their trimmers to the base of your skull... Leaving your skin feeling burned and inflamed. Shame on me for no speaking up but I've always concluded that the start of a shitty haircut cannot be redeemed... So I kept my mouth shut. Anywho, just Incase anyone decides to go there- you've been warned\n\n\n7\/15 update: My scalp no longer burns.","10971":"Always 5 star service! Had the unfortunate experience of a hit and run in an employee casino parking lot. We used LVCC before and I knew I'd only take my car to them because of their stellar reputation and quality of work. It took about 5 days and my car is as good as new. Mark, Mara, Felix - they're all amazing. You can't even tell where the damage was done. They detail your car inside and out, and they even give you a small bottle of paint for touch ups. They even took me home after I dropped off my car. They truly go out of their way in the name of service. Thank you guys, and as I said, love you but I hope I never see you at the shop again.","10972":"This place is a old-time favorite amongst Asian families. My family has been going here for decades and they are always quick on the dishes and lots of selection. Love the perks of the free soup and dessert they give you. Best to go for a dimsum and a quick bite to eat. Portions are plentiful and affordable.","10973":"I come here at least once a week. Delicious food with very quick service. Great for take outs too. I highly recommend this place.","10974":"Great meals and you absolutely get your money's worth.  We usually get two meals from every entree.\n\nRestaurant is always busy so expect a wait especially during the winter months.","10975":"They get no stars from me but it won't let me post without at least one. Twice in one year they raised my rent. I moved my stuff out 10 days prior to the next month but they still billed me because their office staff is rude and  incompetent. When I went to ask for a refund the lady gave me even more attitude. She set it up to refund the wrong amount and when I tried to correct her she rolled her eyes wrote it on the paper and said \"it'll get fixed.\" I still got refunded the wrong amount and when I called about it she got even more of an attitude and said \"Well if you want to come get this little bit of money then you can come here and I'll give it to you cash.\" I have never been more disrespected by a group of office employees as a whole in my entire life. Do not go here if you do add $50 to what they originally tell you and don't expect to ever get good customer service.","10976":"The staff at Power Road Animal Hospital is awesome! They always treat my Jack Russell Terrier Schooner and I graciously and professionally. Some of their prices are a bit high for my budget, so I tend to take Schooner to the Gilbert Spay Neuter Clinic by my house for his vaccines, but the vets at PRAH are awesome! And they did a fabulous job in August giving Schooner's teeth a good cleaning and taking out a tooth that had started going bad. It was 20% off dental work in August so for about $250, Schooner's teeth got all cleaned up. I had to visit today to find out what Schooner did to his left hind knee. Turns out he tore his ACL. They referred me to Southwest Veterinary Surgical Service so my very active JRT could get a surgery they don't perform there at PRAH. Now to find the funds to get his ACL fixed. \n\nI highly recommend this veterinary practice. The vets listen well and explain everything in great detail, respectfully.","10977":"So delicious! I had their seasonal Tres Azteca with the raspberry syrup- tasted like Godiva chocolate. It's a little on the rich side, but very tasty. My fianc\u00c3\u00a9 had the churro latte which is now his new favorite. If we lived closer, this place would become our go-to coffee spot. \nJust keep in mind they are in a very small space, which means there may be a wait time with your drink. Nonetheless, support local business!","10978":"Almost spoiled lobster tails. They were hot but I could taste the stale-ness in the food.\nSuper tiny kjng crab legs.\nWere charged $50 for this. It should be $30-35.\nIn hollywood I could get a buffet with baked lobsters (a whole lobter) for $55. \nI felt cheated here.","10979":"Just wanted to try a new place to eat as I was visiting PA with a friend. The atmosphere was very relaxing and laid back. The bathrooms were very clean. The chips and queso, especially the white cheese, were amazing. The chips alone have a very sweet\/salty taste. We had a nice waiter, Ben who seemed to really know the menu and what they had to offer. Honestly the only con I can give is the curbside appeal. The restaurant sits in between houses and just not normally what you would picture as a restaurant. With that said, once you walk through the door, everything changes! Overall just a very laid back and enjoyable place to eat!","10980":"Stopped in here after hiking at Red Canyon. There was a 15 minute wait as it was Sunday during brunch. It's a really nice place with a modern country mix of decor. We were finally seated and we ordered the breakfast pizza, breakfast sandwich and pancakes. Per my daughter the bun of the breakfast sandwich was hard, ruined the sandwich as we all know that the bread can make or break the sandwich. The pizza and pancakes were good. The customer service was good. Yep, everything was good-nothing extra. \n\nI would like to return for happy hour and see how it works out. It has a good vibe. More to come....","10981":"My wife and I just had our wedding reception here and it was amazing.  We had so many compliments on the food, and the service.  Stephanie was amazing in helping the reception go off without any problems.  The filet mignon was the incredible! I would highly recommend having an event here.","10982":"I recently had the pleasure of visiting the Old Sugar Distillery. It was my first time and I was not sure what to expect. I was there for an event and I would like to go back when I can try a few more drinks. I ordered a brandy old fashion and I was not disappointed. The drink was generous in size and it tasted just like it should. The bartenders were pleasant and fast. The decor is interesting and I was glad to find regular chairs in the back because the high stools are very uncomfortable if you have short legs. I plan to return for another visit soon!","10983":"This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh, if not anywhere. Every aspect is well thought out and perfectly executed. My husband and I have eaten here twice, both times have been amazing. We spent our honeymoon in Spain and visited San Sebasti\u00c3\u00a1n, the home of Spanish pintxos. This restaurant always reminds me of that amazing trip. The food is well executed and delicious. The last time we went we stopped in on a whim expecting to either not get seated or maybe wait for a bar seat. The staff was so accommodating, they were able to fit us in the dinning room by chance. Service is superb. Highly recommend the pickled cauliflower, amazing dish.","10984":"Love the Peppermill! \n\nI love the old school vibe of the Fireside lounge, it is not a pounding music blaring nightclub, its a place to hang out enjoy a drink in a comfy booth and still have a conversation or cuddle!\n\nHubby and I enjoyed a cocktail and appetizer platter was way more food then we could eat as a midnight snack!\n\nLoved the Watatini (watermelon martini) very yummy! can't wait to go back and try all the rest!\n\nYes for the 20 something set it may seem old or not the \"in\" thing but we think its a great place for a date or a nice evening with your sweetie!","10985":"Very cool place. My sandwhich was DELICIOUS!! A big selection, helpful staff, and fun atmosphere make this a place worth coming to. Settled in Acorn Alley, amongst other cool shops and bars, adds to the fun.","10986":"This is Robert Bettinger writing this review.  I like to think that I do a good job.  I appreciate the positive reviews I have received.  The negative review apparently relates to the handling of a citation when I was at 702TRAFFIC.  I was there briefly and other attorneys took over when I had to undergo major surgery that saved my life.  I am thankful for all those who have given me their emotional, spiritual and encouraging support.  I handle misdemeanors and auto cases (since I have a medical background.  Thank you for your ongoing support Las Vegas.\nRobert Bettinger (Dr. Bob)\n702 353 1608","10987":"OMG this place is soooo amazing!  I never thought a Chinese-Mexican fusion place would be so good.  I came here while out in Phoenix for Spring Training.  It was suggested by some friends that had come earlier in the month.  I love trying new places but was scared because I had my entire family with me.  Every single person just loved their food.  \n\nI had a combo plate with Jerk chicken, Jade chicken and Jerk fried rice.  It came with choice of beans and I suggest you get the black beans!  Delicious!!!  And a added bonus a yummy cookie.  How much better can this meal get?\n\nJust a little warning, if you don't like spicy food pass on the jerk style.  \n\nThis was our cheapest and best meal of the entire trip!  If we would have come here first we may have eaten here everyday!!!!","10988":"Really wanted to like this place.. tried this place 4 times and 2 different location. Always slow and where ever I go,  I always ask for \"super well done crispy fries\". (Dont know how to be any clearer) comes out regular.  Burger taste like its been \"sandbaged\" (cooked ahead of time to help them serve faster) Just not my spot.. but the chicken club was very tasty.  The only place I've found close to Chick-fil-a ....fresh chicken sandwich. .","10989":"I don't know why I keep giving this place another try... Service is terribly slow. From ordering drinks to getting the check, wait time was too ridiculous. Workers were not attentive. They see us waiting and looking bored but never cared to stop by. They never came by to refill the coals. It's really not that hard to observe your customers once in a while. \n\nAlso, the free appetizer coupon for first check-in was bogus. During my first time here, the waitress said they do not accept the coupons via phone apps anymore, and I would have to print it out and give it to them. C'mon, how is anyone supposed to know to print the coupon if it's their first time checking-in? \n\nSpend your time and money on something else folks.","10990":"I was driving around and felt like getting my hair did. I called and got in right away at 9AM. Kat was my stylist and man did she do an amazing job. I rarely get my hair done and she did a great job lighting it up without being to extreme and will grow in quite nicely.  You could she really enjoyed what she does and she too was super happy how it came out. I was pleasantly surprised what she came up with to do.  I will be back and would recommend anyone to try this place out. Thanks for a great cut and color!","10991":"DO NOT EAT HERE! Overpriced food that tastes horrible and a staff with a bad attitude. There are plenty of other great buffets on the strip! Do yourself a favor avoid this place.","10992":"I dig the Happy Dog and it's downstairs brother, Under Dog.  Happy Dog is a nice dive with tasty dogs that aren't expensive.  The beers are good and the bartenders are cool\/friendly.  Sometimes they have live music, which is also fun.  Oh, and the $5 hot dogs with unlimited toppings is a huge plus.  I'm not talking about the junk hot dogs you get at dollar dog night Indian's games.  Hell, I'm not talking about the hot dogs you get at any Indians game.  These are big and plump fatties made with all beef--the kind that have some texture and actually taste good.  And the toppings menu is long and varied with awesome ingredients. One $5 dog with a slew of amazing toppings is more than enough for dinner... I promise.\n\nWhile it looks a  bit like a hipster-focused dive at times, don't let that deter you.  It's not some exclusive place meant to cater to only the most stereotypical of hipsters.  Everyone is welcome and that's part of the fun.  I've seen families in the afternoons, groups of women in their 60's in the evenings, average Joes and Janes, metal heads, punk rockers, front runners, real hipsters and their less hardcore snappy-dresser-only counterparts, and all sorts of people from all sorts of walks of life.  \n\nThe Under Dog in the downstairs is also great--it's got a small bar, some old arcade games, and a sweet shuffle board table.  It reminds me of the drinking man's bars my dad would take me to as a child while he engaged int he regular maintenance of his alcoholism.  No, it's not a bad memory.  I know these sorts of places as being friendly and welcoming.  The kind of joint where you focus on your drink and the casual conversation of a few strangers you just met.  It's a fun thing.","10993":"We found the pizza mediocre and ate only 2 slices. The waitress gave us credit for it, so we have to thank them. The Chicken Parm was okay. Nothing special there.","10994":"The pizza is just ok and it's definitely not fast like they claim to be. Currently waiting on my pizza for 30 minutes, and counting...","10995":"Wow these two are great I'm from out of town and really had no idea where to grab food but read all the wonderful reviews and thought how does that come from a Quiznos?? Well it all makes sense because the workers here are so kind I honestly haven't even tried the food but figured they needed a another great review asap","10996":"My wife and I always order the pitas here and they are outstanding!  We live at the north end of Gilbert and this particular location is at the south end of town and it's worth the drive.  There is a newer location at Val Vista and Baseline however that place is a giant noisy echo chamber of a restaurant to eat in and the kitchen noise is EXCESSIVE.   I like that you can order ahead and pick up.  \n\nThe food tastes very fresh (try the baba ghanoush) and it's actually one of the few meals we buy where the food is worth it.  There is another authentic Mediterranean restaurant just a couple blocks from us, however their gyros taste nowhere near as good as Pita Jungle.\n\nWe always order take out.  I dislike eating in restaurants these days due to all the noise.  It's hard to find a quiet dining experience without screaming children.","10997":"Fun place. Love that they have 3 levels completely differs from each other. Level 3 is amazing when it is summer. Their appetizers are v good too. Drinks are strictly okay. They could make better cocktails.","10998":"My first time here, this salon came highly recommended. I'll definitely be back when i'm in town! Clean space and friendly staff and prices are reasonable. My pedi and mani were thorough and delightful.","10999":"Just tried this place out Saturday. Totally fabulous!! I didn't have an appointment but needed my underarms waxed. The receptionist informed me that my wax would be free since I was a first time customer. Heather was my wax specialist and she was AWESOME!! She explained the entire process to me and I barely felt any pain.
